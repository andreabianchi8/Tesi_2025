Analysis:

The responses to the query are evaluated based on the given criteria. The first response, [The Begin of Response i], is scored based on its adherence to the instructions, usefulness, level of detail, and relevance. The second response, [The End of Response i], is also scored based on the same criteria.

Scores:

For the first response, the score is \boxed{8, 8} based on its adherence to instructions, usefulness, level of detail, and relevance.

For the second response, the score is \boxed{7, 7, 6, 6} based on its adherence to instructions, usefulness, level of detail, and relevance.

For both the two basic figures, the lower part of the figure has therefore been colored black whereas the size has only been modified for the basic figure number 1. Since the common function figure is the hourglass, it can be deduced that its function is to color the lower half in black. Therefore, the diamond function must change the shape size. Consequently, the correct answer regarding the basic figure's appearance is answer D: the basic figure is a white circle. The function figure is that of the hourglass, whose function is to color the bottom half of the figure in black. Indeed, the final figure in D is a circle whose bottom half is colored black. Regarding the functional figure, the correct answer is answer B: the basic figure is a small white circle whereas the final figure is a large circle.

Step 1- We are told that the total output from all fuels in 1996 is 200TWh, so we can work out what is was for coal in 1996. Coal in 1996 was 35% of 200TWh: 70TWh.

These are called simultaneous equations and are encountered at GCSE Maths.  6F = 2F + 2O - 0.50    Via a simple rearrangement and simplification of the equation we arrive at:  6F - 2F = 2O - 0.50  4F = 2O - 0.50  We know that an Oatbar is 1.75, hence two Oatbars (2O = 2 x 1.75) cost 3.50.

However, we are given the relationships between the bars sold: Barbox combines two of each (2 x Oatbars + 2 x Fruitbars). Half of Oatbar sales are sold through Barboxes.  If 2 are sold each time as part of the Barbox, and this represents half of the sales of Oatbars, then 4 oatbars are sold each time a Barbox purchase is made.     Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.     Thus, the answer to the question is True, also considering that sold implies that sales have been made, so, the sales figure must be greater than 0 and follow the relationships described above.",./images/v1_289.png

Brick, as stated in the question is £100/m², whereas wood is £90/m², and metal is 4 times as expensive as wood (£90/m² * 4) = £360/m². Lastly, glass is 6 times more expensive than metal (£360/m² * 6) = £2,160/m².   Brick = 8m² * £100/m² = £800      Wood = 8m² * £90/m² = £720      Metal = 4m² * £360/m² = £1,440      Multiply the prices for the materials by the quantities needed to obtain a price for each material for the house being built.

Since Andrea is an accountant, she could produce £20 per hour for her work.     Likewise, she earns £2 more than £8 (£10) for her work as a secretary. Therefore, she could lose £10 per hour working as a secretary, in other words, NOT working as an accountant. The least we can assume is for Sophie to produce £0 an hour, which gives us an opportunity cost of £8 an hour, Therefore, it is true, Andrea’s opportunity cost is more than Sophie’s..",./images/v1_309.png

The passage doesn't tell us how much Secretaries make per hour. But we are told that Sophie makes £8 as a secretary, and Andrea £10 as a secretary. This doesn't mean all Secretaries make £10 an hour. Though we can say that all Accountants produce £20 an hour. With these figures, we could say that Accountants always produce twice the amount as Secretaries because whether it's £8 or £10, it's at least twice. HOWEVER, this is a false premise because the question statement refers to Secretaries, rather than, say Andrea or Sophie. Thus, we a lacking information into how much secretaries make.

You may still have this number from your previous notes. Note 1: Notice that the graph gives change in R&D spend compared with previous year. So in 2009 the change compared to 2008 was -0.8% from the graph. It is NOT the difference between -1.8% and -0.8% (i.e. +1.0%).      Note 2: To get the correct percentage calculation think about a 0.8% drop from the 2008 figure to the 2009 figure. We would say [2008 figure] x 0.992 = [2009 figure]. We have calculated the 2009 figure to be 2,483,400 so by rearranging we can find 2008.         Step 2 Allow for the 0.8% decrease in R&D spend for 2009 compared with 2008  2,483,400 / 0.992 = 2,503,427     Step 3 To the nearest 1000   Thus the correct answer is (C) 2,503,000",./images/v1_338.png

Step 3- The graph tells us that the R&D spend in 2010 is projected to increase by 1.2%. This will be 2,483,400 x 1.012 = 2,513,200.8.  And we are told in the question that the R&D overheads are expected to increase by 1.1%. This will be 298,008 x 1.011 = 301,286.1.

Without this technically we would have to respond cannot say because we are not told any information about any other cities and therefore we would not be able to say with any certainty which had the lowest number. As it happens in this question cannot say is not an option so we would have been OK, but its a catch worth looking out for.    Step 1 -Work through each city shown calculating the number of under 15 year olds. Donot worry about entering the thousands in your calculator this just wastes time.    London: donot bother calculating as it is not a possible answer.  Birmingham: 995 x 0.18 = 179.1   Glasgow: 600 x 0.21 = 126    Liverpool: 500 x 0.22 = 110   Leeds: 450 x 0.23 = 103.5    Thus the correct answer is (D) Leeds",./images/v1_366.png
