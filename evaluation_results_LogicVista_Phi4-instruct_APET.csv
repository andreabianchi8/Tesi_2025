(D) MDBs are established as international ventures. (E) An aim of MDBs is to provide economic development.

Let's think step-by-step:

1. The argument states that MDBs generally receive donations from developed nations, often labelled as foreign aid. This implies that MDBs are established as international ventures, as they are supported by multiple countries. Therefore, statement (D) is likely to be true.

2. The argument also mentions that MDBs lend money to developing nations in the form of very long term loans below the market rate of interest and through grants. This means that loans from MDBs are not typically short-term loans, making statement (C) demonstrably false.

3. The argument does not provide any information that suggests developing nations will not eventually pay back their loans. Therefore, statement (A) cannot be confirmed as false based on the given information.

4. The argument does not contradict the claim that loans from MDBs are below the market rate of interest. Therefore, statement (B) cannot be confirmed as false based on the given information.

5. The argument states that MDBs provide financial services and professional advice in order to further economic development. This aligns with statement (E), which suggests that an aim of MDBs is to provide economic development. Therefore, statement (E) cannot be confirmed as false based on the given information.

The correct answer is: C.",C,"Taking each line in the argument to be true, which statement must be demonstrably false? Select from A, B, C, D and E.

(D) MDBs are established as international ventures. (E) An aim of MDBs is to provide economic development.

Let's think step-by-step:
- The argument states that MDBs lend money to developing nations in the form of very long-term loans below the market rate of interest and through grants. This directly contradicts option (C) which states that MDBs lend money as typically short-term loans.
- The argument also states that MDBs are established by a group of countries that provide financial services and professional advice in order to further economic development. This supports option (E) which states that an aim of MDBs is to provide economic development.
- The argument does not provide any information that would make option (A) false, as it is common for developing nations to eventually pay back their loans.
- The argument does not provide any information that would make option (B) false, as it is common for MDBs to lend money below the market rate of interest.
- The argument does not provide any information that would make option (D) false, as it is common for MDBs to be established as international ventures.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) MDBs lend money as typically short-term loans.

Reasoning:
1. First, we need to determine the spending on IT hardware, IT software, and IT consulting in Year 4 and Year 5.
2. Then, we need to calculate the increase in spending for each category from Year 4 to Year 5.
3. After that, we need to add the increase to the spending in Year 5 to get the spending in Year 6 for each category.
4. Finally, we need to sum the spending in Year 6 for all three categories to get the total legal sector spending in Year 6.

Answer:
The correct answer is: C. £95 million.",['numerical'],E,"Step 1- Calculate the increases in each IT spending category IT hardware = 45 (increase of £5 million from Year 4) IT software = 30 (increase of £5 million from Year 4) IT consulting = 20 (increase of £5 million from Year 4) Step 2- Calculate the total for the year after the projected year 5. Since there is an even increase the same increase of £5 million will occur in IT hardware, software and consulting.  Total = 45 + 30 + 20 + (3 x 5) = £110 million  Thus the correct answer is (E) £110 million ",../images/v1_56.png

Expert 3: IT consulting will not match that of Year 2, so statement (B) is false.
Expert 4: IT software will exceed IT consulting, so statement (C) is true.
Expert 5: Spending on IT hardware will not decline, so statement (D) is false.

Reasoning phase:
Let's think step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the profit for the Government in the Pacific Rim.
From the image, the profit for the Government in the Pacific Rim is 3.6 million pounds.

Step 2: Convert the profit to £100,000s.
3.6 million pounds is equivalent to 3600 £100,000s.

Step 3: Use the given ratio to find the turnover.
The ratio of profit to turnover is 2:15. This means for every 2 parts of profit, there are 15 parts of turnover.

Step 4: Calculate the turnover.
Let the turnover be T. According to the ratio, 2/15 = 3600/TP, where TP is the turnover in £100,000s.
Cross-multiplying gives 2 * TP = 15 * 3600.
Simplifying, TP = (15 * 3600) / 2.
TP = 27000 / 2.
TP = 13500.

Step 5: Convert the turnover back to £100,000s.
13500 £100,000s is equivalent to 135 £100,000s.

The correct answer is: 135.

Answer:
The correct answer is: 135.",['numerical'],C,"Step 1- Contracts ratio of profit (£3.6million) to turnover = 2:15 Turnover = £3.6 million x 15/2 = £27 million = 270 (in £100,000s) Thus the correct answer is (C) 270 ",../images/v1_60.png

""""""","Let's think step-by-step:

1. First, we need to determine the profit per employee for Company B. The annual profit for Company B is £26,000, and it has 8 employees. Therefore, the profit per employee is £26,000 / 8 = £3,250.

2. Next, we need to find out how many employees Company B would need to achieve an annual profit of £39,000. To do this, we divide the target profit by the profit per employee: £39,000 / £3,250 ≈ 12 employees.

3. Company B currently has 8 employees. To find out how many extra employees are needed, we subtract the current number of employees from the required number of employees: 12 - 8 = 4 employees.

The correct answer is: D. 4",A,"Let's think step-by-step.

Step 1: Calculate the profit per employee for Company B.
Company B has an annual profit of £26,000 and 8 employees. Therefore, the profit per employee is £26,000 / 8 = £3,250.

Step 2: Determine the number of employees needed to achieve an annual profit of £39,000.
To find the number of employees needed to achieve an annual profit of £39,000, we divide the target profit by the profit per employee.
£39,000 / £3,250 = 12 employees.

Step 3: Calculate the number of extra employees needed.
Company B currently has 8 employees. To achieve an annual profit of £39,000, they would need 12 employees. Therefore, they would need to recruit 12 - 8 = 4 extra employees.

1. First, we need to find the total number of people sampled. This is the sum of the number of males and females in the table. The total number of males is 1,343,000 and the total number of females is 1,031,000. So, the total number of people sampled is 1,343,000 + 1,031,000 = 2,374,000.

2. Next, we need to find the total number of unemployed people. The number of unemployed males is 52,000 and the number of unemployed females is 43,000. So, the total number of unemployed people is 52,000 + 43,000 = 95,000.

3. Now, we need to find the percentage of unemployed people. To do this, we divide the total number of unemployed people by the total number of people sampled and multiply by 100. So, the percentage of unemployed people is (95,000 / 2,374,000) * 100 = 4%.

Step 1: Identify the relevant data for September.
- Ribley: 6 accidents, 76,000 vehicles on the road
- Wartop: 18 accidents, 101,000 vehicles on the road
- Surren: 20 accidents, 104,000 vehicles on the road

Step 2: Calculate the total number of accidents and total number of vehicles on the road for September.
- Total accidents: 6 (Ribley) + 18 (Wartop) + 20 (Surren) = 44
- Total vehicles: 76,000 (Ribley) + 101,000 (Wartop) + 104,000 (Surren) = 281,000

Step 3: Calculate the average accident cost per vehicle on the road in September.
- Average cost per accident: £1,900 (Ribley) + £3,200 (Wartop) + £1,050 (Surren) = £6,150
- Average cost per vehicle: £6,150 / 281,000 = £0.0218

Step 4: Compare the calculated average cost per vehicle with the given options.
- The closest option to £0.0218 is £0.17.

The correct answer is: A.",['numerical'],B,"Step 1- We need to first find the total costs of all accidents for all towns: (£1,900 x 6) + (£3,200 x 18) + (£1,050 x 20) = £90,000. Step 2- Now divide this by the total number of vehicles on the road for all three towns (76,000 + 101,000 + 104,000) = 281,000.  Step 3- So £90,000 ÷ 281,000 = £0.320.

You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

Input for question:
You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

The image shows a sequence of transformations applied to a symbol, and a question with a missing symbol. Your task is to determine which transformation should be applied to the symbol on the left to obtain the symbol on the right, and then apply that transformation to the symbol in the question to find the correct answer.

Let's think step-by-step:
1. Observe the transformations applied to the symbol on the left in the image.
2. Identify the transformation that results in the symbol on the right.
3. Apply the identified transformation to the symbol in the question.
4. Compare the result with the given options A, B, C, and D to find the correct answer.

The transformations are as follows:
- The first transformation rotates all symbols 90° clockwise.
- The second transformation rotates the middle symbol 180°.
- The third transformation moves each symbol one place to the right.
- The fourth transformation reflects all symbols in the X axis.

Now, let's apply the transformations to the symbol in the question:
- The symbol on the left is a circle with a line through it.
- The symbol on the right is a circle with a line through it, but the line is horizontal.

The correct transformation to apply is the one that moves each symbol one place to the right, which is the third transformation.

The correct answer is: C.

You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

Input for question:
You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

The image shows a series of transformations applied to a set of symbols. The question asks which transformation will result in the symbol shown in the question mark. Let's think step-by-step.

1. The first transformation mirrors the 1st and 2nd symbol in the Y axis.
2. The second transformation moves each symbol one place to the left.
3. The third transformation changes the size of the 1st and 3rd symbol.
4. The fourth transformation changes shading on full sized symbols.

Now, let's apply these transformations to the given options:

(A) The first transformation will mirror the 1st and 2nd symbol in the Y axis. The 1st symbol will be a circle and the 2nd symbol will be a square. The 3rd symbol will be a square.

(B) The second transformation will move each symbol one place to the left. The 1st symbol will be a circle, the 2nd symbol will be a square, and the 3rd symbol will be a square.

(C) The third transformation will change the size of the 1st and 3rd symbol. The 1st symbol will be a circle, the 2nd symbol will be a square, and the 3rd symbol will be a square.

(D) The fourth transformation will change shading on full sized symbols. The 1st symbol will be a circle, the 2nd symbol will be a square, and the 3rd symbol will be a square.

The correct answer is: C. The third transformation will change the size of the 1st and 3rd symbol.

Input for question:
You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

The image shows a series of transformations applied to a set of symbols. The question asks which transformation will result in the same set of symbols as shown in the image on the right. The transformations are represented by symbols and arrows, and the symbols on the right are the result of applying the transformation to the symbols on the left.

Let's think step-by-step:
1. The first transformation switches the 2nd and 3rd symbols.
2. The second transformation switches the 1st and 3rd symbols.
3. The third transformation changes the shading of symbols with a round edge.
4. The fourth transformation reflects all symbols in the X axis.

Now, let's apply these transformations to the symbols on the left to see which one matches the symbols on the right.

(A) The first transformation switches the 2nd and 3rd symbols, resulting in the symbols on the right.
(B) The second transformation switches the 1st and 3rd symbols, resulting in the symbols on the right.
(C) The third transformation changes the shading of symbols with a round edge, resulting in the symbols on the right.
(D) The fourth transformation reflects all symbols in the X axis, resulting in the symbols on the right.

The correct answer is: A, B, C, or D.

Input for question:
You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

The image shows a series of transformations applied to a set of symbols, and you need to determine which transformation will result in the symbol set shown in the question. The transformations include rotating symbols 90 degrees clockwise, rotating the middle symbol 180 degrees, mirroring symbols in the Y axis, and reflecting symbols in the X axis.

Let's think step-by-step:
1. Identify the initial symbol set.
2. Apply the transformations in the order they are given.
3. Compare the resulting symbol set with the options provided.

The initial symbol set is a combination of a plus sign, a vertical line, and a horizontal line.
1. Rotate all symbols 90 degrees clockwise: The plus sign becomes a vertical line, the vertical line becomes a horizontal line, and the horizontal line becomes a plus sign.
2. Rotate the middle symbol 180 degrees: The plus sign becomes a minus sign.
3. Mirror the 1st and 2nd symbol in the Y axis: The vertical line becomes a horizontal line, and the horizontal line becomes a vertical line.
4. Reflect all symbols in the X axis: The plus sign becomes a minus sign, the minus sign becomes a plus sign, the vertical line becomes a horizontal line, and the horizontal line becomes a vertical line.

The resulting symbol set is a combination of a minus sign, a vertical line, and a horizontal line.
The correct answer is: B.

Input for question:
You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.

The image shows a sequence of symbols and arrows indicating transformations. The first row shows symbols being switched or moved. The second row shows symbols being replaced. The third row shows a sequence of symbols being transformed by a series of operations.

Let's think step-by-step. First, we need to understand the transformations shown in the image. The first row shows that the 2nd and 3rd symbols are switched, the 1st and 3rd symbols are switched, each symbol moves one place to the left, and circles are replaced with triangles. The second row shows a sequence of symbols being transformed by these operations.

Now, let's apply these transformations to the sequence of symbols in the third row. The sequence of symbols is: circle, triangle, square, circle, triangle, square. Applying the transformations step-by-step:

1. Switch the 2nd and 3rd symbols: circle, square, triangle, circle, square, triangle.
2. Switch the 1st and 3rd symbols: square, circle, triangle, square, circle, triangle.
3. Each symbol moves one place to the left: triangle, square, circle, square, circle, triangle.
4. Replace circles with triangles: triangle, square, triangle, square, triangle, triangle.

The final sequence of symbols is: triangle, square, triangle, square, triangle, triangle.

The correct answer is: (D).

Reasoning:
To find the proportionate value of grade A to C grade Wireless Headphones produced in 2018, we need to look at the graph and find the values for grade A and grade C in 2018. From the graph, we can see that the value for grade A in 2018 is 20,000 and the value for grade C in 2018 is 40,000. To find the proportionate value, we divide the value for grade A by the value for grade C. So, 20,000 / 40,000 = 0.5. Therefore, the proportionate value of grade A to C grade Wireless Headphones produced in 2018 is 0.5:1. However, this option is not available in the given choices. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 1.06:1.
The correct answer is: 1.06:1.",['numerical'],B," The correct answer is B. Step 1:  Make sure you get the ration the correct way round.  Start by writing this down in a ratio format: Grade A : Grade C Step 2:  Calculate the value of the two classes of headphones: Grade A:    20,000 ÷ 50 × $500    =    $200,000 Grade C:    75,000 ÷ 50 × $150    =    $225,000 Step 3:  Write these values underneath the ratio you wrote down in step 1. Grade A : Grade C $200,000 : $225,000  Step 4:  Divide the first number by the second to calculate the ratio: $200,000 ÷ $225,000 = 0.8888  0.89:1 ",../images/v1_204.png

Let's think step-by-step. First, we know that all sweet dogs are dogs with long hairs. This means that every sweet dog has long hair. Second, we know that some pittbulls are not dogs with long hairs. This means that there are pittbulls that do not have long hair. Now, let's consider the options:

(A) No sweet dogs are dogs with long hairs: This is incorrect because we know that all sweet dogs are dogs with long hairs.

(B) No dogs with long hairs are pittbulls: This is incorrect because we know that all sweet dogs are dogs with long hairs, and sweet dogs are a subset of dogs with long hairs.

(C) No pittbulls are dogs with long hairs: This is correct because we know that some pittbulls are not dogs with long hairs.

- Crafting an expert who is an expert at the given task, by writing a high-quality description about the most capable and suitable agent to answer the instruction in second person perspective.
- Explaining step-by-step how the problem should be tackled, and making sure the model explains step-by-step how it came to the answer. You can do this by adding ""Let's think step-by-step"".
- Imagining three different experts who are discussing the problem at hand. All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking, then share it with the group. Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc. If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.

Second, Susan's favorite type of cake is lemon, but she wasn't seen anywhere near the staffroom. This also makes it less likely for her to have taken the lemon cake.

Step 2: Calculate the difference in the average speeds.
- The difference in the average speeds is 82 mph - 82 mph = 0 mph.

Step 3: Round the difference to the nearest mph.

- Cost for 150 other network minutes: 150 * 32p = £48
- Total monthly cost under Royal Plan: £52 + £48 = £100
- Annual cost under Royal Plan: £100 * 12 = £1200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of using 200 same network and 150 other network minutes per month under the Gem Plan.
- Cost for 200 same network minutes: 200 * 25p = £50
- Cost for 150 other network minutes: 150 * 30p = £45
- Total monthly cost under Gem Plan: £50 + £45 = £95

    ""The correct answer is: X,Y or The correct answer is: X. Where X,Y are respectively the possible solutions.""

Reasoning:
Let's think step-by-step.

Expert 1: First, we need to calculate the number of free minutes for standard calls and texts during the Gem Plan period. The Gem Plan offers 250 free minutes for standard calls and 200 free texts. Since the customer is on the Gem Plan from the start of March to the end of July, that's 5 months. So, the total free minutes for standard calls would be 250 minutes/month * 5 months = 1,250 minutes. The total free texts would be 200 texts.

Expert 2: Next, we need to calculate the number of free minutes for standard calls and texts during the Royal Plan period. The Royal Plan offers 300 free minutes for standard calls and 150 free texts. Since the customer is on the Royal Plan from the start of August to the end of November, that's 4 months. So, the total free minutes for standard calls would be 300 minutes/month * 4 months = 1,200 minutes. The total free texts would be 150 texts.

Expert 3: Finally, we need to add the free minutes and texts from both plans. The total free minutes for standard calls would be 1,250 minutes + 1,200 minutes = 2,450 minutes. The total free texts would be 200 texts + 150 texts = 350 texts.

The correct answer is: 2,450 mins, 350 texts. However, this option is not available in the given choices. Therefore, the correct answer is: The correct answer is: 2,450 mins, 350 texts. Where X,Y are respectively the possible solutions.
",['numerical'],A," The correct answer is A.  Step 1 – Sum the Gem Plan’s allocation for 5 months    250 mins x 5 = 1,250 mins  200 texts x 5 = 1,000 texts   Step 2 – Sum the Royale Plan’s allocation for 4 months   300 mins x 4 = 1,200 mins    150 texts x 4 = 600 texts   Step 3 – Sum Steps 1 and 2   1,250 mins + 1,200 mins = 2,450 mins   1000 texts + 600 texts = 1,600 texts   Thus the correct answer is, 2,450 mins; 1,600 texts",../images/v1_260.png

These are called simultaneous equations and are encountered at GCSE Maths.  6F = 2F + 2O - 0.50    Via a simple rearrangement and simplification of the equation we arrive at:  6F - 2F = 2O - 0.50  4F = 2O - 0.50  We know that an Oatbar is 1.75, hence two Oatbars (2O = 2 x 1.75) cost 3.50.

""",['deductive'],A," We have not been given the sales figures. However, we are given the relationships between the bars sold: Barbox combines two of each (2 x Oatbars + 2 x Fruitbars). Half of Oatbar sales are sold through Barboxes.  If 2 are sold each time as part of the Barbox, and this represents half of the sales of Oatbars, then 4 oatbars are sold each time a Barbox purchase is made.     Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.     Thus, the answer to the question is True, also considering that sold implies that sales have been made, so, the sales figure must be greater than 0 and follow the relationships described above.",../images/v1_289.png

1. The argument states that Britain's national debt can be traced to a deal struck between a syndicate of City traders and merchants, and William III. This means that the national debt involved William III, making statement (A) true.

2. The syndicate agreed to finance William's war against France in return for a parliamentary decree that their investment would be returned. This means that the syndicate would make a profit from their loan, making statement (B) true.

3. The return would include an 8% interest rate per annum, and £4000 a year management fee of the loan. This means that the national debt is decreed by William III to be paid by investors, making statement (C) true.

4. The syndicate provided loan management for a fee, making statement (D) true.

5. The argument does not mention anything about the national debt existing conceptually before this agreement. Therefore, statement (E) cannot be demonstrably false based on the given information.

The correct answer is: E.",E,"Taking each line in the argument to be true, which statement must be demonstrably false? Select from A, B, C, D, and E. (A) Britain national debt involved William II. (B) The syndicate would make a profit from their loan. (C) National debt is decreed by William III to be paid by investors. (D) The syndicate provided loan management for a fee. (E) National debt did not exist conceptually before this agreement

Let's think step-by-step:
1. The argument states that Britain's national debt can be traced to a deal struck between a syndicate of City traders and merchants, and William III. This implies that the national debt involved William III, making statement (A) true.
2. The syndicate agreed to finance William's war against France in return for a parliamentary decree that their investment would be returned. This means the syndicate would make a profit from their loan, making statement (B) true.
3. The return would include an 8% interest rate per annum, and £4000 a year management fee of the loan. This indicates that the syndicate provided loan management for a fee, making statement (D) true.
4. The argument does not mention that the national debt did not exist conceptually before this agreement, so statement (E) cannot be demonstrably false based on the given information.
5. The argument does not mention that the national debt is decreed by William III to be paid by investors, so statement (C) cannot be demonstrably false based on the given information.

Step 1: Identify the annual salaries for Debra and Lucas.
Debra has a Foxtrot contract, which means her annual salary is £100,000.
Lucas has a Beta contract, which means his annual salary is £20,000.

Step 2: Calculate the total earnings for each person at the end of their contract.
Debra's contract length is 24 months, so her total earnings are £100,000 * 24 = £2,400,000.
Lucas's contract length is 6 months, so his total earnings are £20,000 * 6 = £120,000.

Step 3: Determine how much more money Debra earns than Lucas.

Since Andrea is an accountant, she could produce £20 per hour for her work.     Likewise, she earns £2 more than £8 (£10) for her work as a secretary. Therefore, she could lose £10 per hour working as a secretary, in other words, NOT working as an accountant.

The correct answer is: B. False.

Let's think step-by-step. First, we know that Andrea produces £2 per hour more in her secretarial work than Sophie. This means that if Andrea did the secretarial work instead of Sophie, she would be producing £2 more per hour. Over a 40-hour working week, this would result in an additional £80 of work (40 hours * £2/hour = £80). However, the question states that Andrea would have an opportunity cost of £80, which means that she would be giving up the opportunity to earn £80 by not doing her accountant work. Since the opportunity cost is the potential money lost, the statement is false because the opportunity cost is not £80 but rather the potential earnings from her accountant work. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) False.

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

1. The given text states that copyright is a legal means to protect an author's work, giving them the exclusive right to reproduce, license, or exploit their work. This means that copyright is a legal requirement and is obeyed by all, which makes statement (C) demonstrably false.

2. The text also mentions that there are exceptions and limitations to copyright, which allow for works under copyright to be used without a license. This means that fair use is an exception to copyright, making statement (B) true.

3. The text further explains that fair use allows for a legally unlicensed use provided the work is used for criticism, parody, research, or reporting the news. This means that using copyrighted work for criticism is not illegal, making statement (A) true.

4. The text does not mention anything about copyright allowing the author to report their work to the news, so statement (D) cannot be confirmed as true or false based on the given information.

5. The text also states that fair use allows someone other than the author to parody their work, making statement (E) true.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) Copyright is obeyed by all.",A,"Taking each line in the argument to be true, which statement must be demonstrably false? Select from A, B, C, D and E.  (A) Using copyrighted work for criticism is illegal. (B) Fair use is an exception to copyright. (C) Copyright is obeyed by all. (D) Copyright allows the author to report their work to the news. (E) Fair use allows someone other than the author to parody their work.

Let's think step-by-step:
1. The argument states that copyright is a legal means to protect an author's work, giving them the exclusive right to reproduce, license or exploit their work. This means that statement (C) ""Copyright is obeyed by all"" is likely to be demonstrably false, as not all entities may obey copyright laws.
2. The argument also mentions that there are exceptions and limitations to copyright, which allow for works under copyright to be used without a license. This supports statement (B) ""Fair use is an exception to copyright"".
3. The argument further explains that fair use allows for a legally unlicensed use provided the work is used for criticism, parody, research or reporting the news. This supports statement (E) ""Fair use allows someone other than the author to parody their work"".
4. The argument does not provide any information that would make statement (A) ""Using copyrighted work for criticism is illegal"" demonstrably false.
5. The argument does not provide any information that would make statement (D) ""Copyright allows the author to report their work to the news"" demonstrably false.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C.",['deductive'],A,"The other statements can be found to be true. However, line 3 states that under ‘fair use’ one can use a copyrighted work for criticism. And is not illegal. Therefore, this statement is false.",../images/v1_319.png

1. The first statement is that copyright gives legal control to the author of the work. This is a fundamental aspect of copyright law, so this statement is likely true.

2. The second statement is that to reproduce a copyrighted work without a license is illegal. This is also true, as copyright law protects the rights of the author to control the reproduction of their work.

3. The third statement is that copyright has limitations and exceptions to its legal rights. This is true, as there are certain circumstances under which copyrighted material can be used without a license, such as fair use.

4. The fourth statement is that one can obtain a license to copyright material outside of fair use legal territory. This is not true, as fair use is a legal exception that allows for the use of copyrighted material without a license in certain circumstances.

5. The fifth statement is that parody is not a limitation to copyright. This is true, as parody is a recognized exception to copyright law that allows for the use of copyrighted material in a transformative way.

Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is (D) One can obtain a license to copyright material outside of fair use legal territory.

Reasoning:
To find the average annual percentage change in Teala Media's R&D spend across the 5 years shown, we need to calculate the average of the percentage changes for each year. The percentage changes for each year are as follows:
- 2006: 2.00%
- 2007: 1.00%
- 2008: -1.00%
- 2009: 0.00%
- 2010: 1.00%

To calculate the average, we add up the percentage changes and divide by the number of years:
(2.00% + 1.00% + (-1.00%) + 0.00% + 1.00%) / 5 = 0.60%

The correct answer is not listed in the options, so we need to check our calculations again. After rechecking, we find that the correct average annual percentage change is 0.60%. Therefore, the correct answer is not listed in the options.

The correct answer is: None of the given options are correct.

Note 1: Notice that the graph gives change in R&D spend compared with previous year. So in 2009 the change compared to 2008 was -0.8% from the graph. It is NOT the difference between -1.8% and -0.8% (i.e. +1.0%).      Note 2: To get the correct percentage calculation think about a 0.8% drop from the 2008 figure to the 2009 figure. We would say [2008 figure] x 0.992 = [2009 figure]. We have calculated the 2009 figure to be 2,483,400 so by rearranging we can find 2008.

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the number of shares each director bought or sold across the 2-month period shown. We can do this by looking at the table provided in the image.

Geoffrey Yates:
At 1st April 2009: 1,100 shares
At 30th April 2009: 1,050 shares
At 31st May 2009: 910 shares
Change in shares: 1,100 - 1,050 = 50 shares (sold)

Tobey Gilham:
At 1st April 2009: 1,050 shares
At 30th April 2009: 950 shares
At 31st May 2009: 820 shares
Change in shares: 1,050 - 950 = 100 shares (sold)

Susan Preddy:
At 1st April 2009: 950 shares
At 30th April 2009: 820 shares
At 31st May 2009: 250 shares
Change in shares: 950 - 820 = 130 shares (sold)
Change in shares: 820 - 250 = 570 shares (sold)
Total change in shares: 130 + 570 = 700 shares (sold)

Samantha Hoxton:
At 1st April 2009: 990 shares
At 30th April 2009: 1,100 shares
At 31st May 2009: 550 shares
Change in shares: 990 - 1,100 = -110 shares (bought)
Change in shares: 1,100 - 550 = 550 shares (sold)
Total change in shares: 550 - 110 = 440 shares (sold)

Trudy Stupples:
At 1st April 2009: 1,200 shares
At 30th April 2009: 960 shares
At 31st May 2009: 2,400 shares
Change in shares: 1,200 - 960 = 240 shares (bought)
Change in shares: 960 - 2,400 = -1,440 shares (sold)
Total change in shares: 240 - 1,440 = -1,200 shares (sold)

From the above calculations, we can see that Susan Preddy has bought or sold the largest number of shares across the 2-month period shown, with a total of 700 shares sold.

The correct answer is: D. Susan Preddy.",B,"Prompt to optimize:

""""""

Reasoning phase:
Let's think step-by-step.

Expert 1: We need to calculate the total number of shares bought or sold by each director over the two-month period. We can do this by subtracting the number of shares held at the beginning of the period from the number of shares held at the end of the period.

Expert 2: Geoffrey Yates bought 910 - 1,100 = -190 shares, which means he sold 190 shares. Tobey Gilham bought 820 - 1,050 = -230 shares, which means he sold 230 shares. Susan Preddy bought 250 - 950 = -700 shares, which means she sold 700 shares. Samantha Hoxton bought 550 - 990 = -440 shares, which means she sold 440 shares. Trudy Stupples bought 2,400 - 1,200 = 1,200 shares, which means she bought 1,200 shares.

Expert 3: Based on the calculations, Trudy Stupples has the largest number of shares bought or sold, which is 1,200 shares.

The correct answer is: B. Trudy Stupples.",['numerical'],B,Step 1- The largest number of shares can be found by calculating the differences in shareholdings between the periods 1stApril TO 30 April and 30 April TO 31stMay.,../images/v1_342.png

The correct answer is: C, 919.50 million. 
Let's think step-by-step:

1. Calculate the scaled back forecast for the Northern region:
   - Original forecast: 320 million
   - Scaled back by a quarter: 320 * 0.25 = 80 million
   - New forecast: 320 - 80 = 240 million

2. Calculate the scaled back forecast for the Western region:
   - Original forecast: 270 million
   - Scaled back by a quarter: 270 * 0.25 = 67.5 million
   - New forecast: 270 - 67.5 = 202.5 million

3. Calculate the scaled back forecast for the Southern region:
   - Original forecast: 165 million
   - Scaled back by a fifth: 165 * 0.20 = 33 million
   - New forecast: 165 - 33 = 132 million

4. Calculate the scaled back forecast for the Eastern region:
   - Original forecast: 275 million
   - Scaled back by a fifth: 275 * 0.20 = 55 million
   - New forecast: 275 - 55 = 220 million

5. The Central region's forecast remains unchanged at 125 million.

6. Add the new forecasts for all regions to get the total projected sales:
   - Northern: 240 million
   - Western: 202.5 million
   - Southern: 132 million
   - Eastern: 220 million
   - Central: 125 million

   Total projected sales = 240 + 202.5 + 132 + 220 + 125 = 919.5 million

Therefore, the total projected sales for all 5 regions is 919.5 million.

Answer:
""""""
Let's think step-by-step. First, we need to calculate the scaled back projections for each region. For the Northern and Western regions, the projections are scaled back by a quarter, and for the Southern and Eastern regions, they are scaled back by a fifth.

Northern: 320 million * 0.75 = 240 million
Western: 270 million * 0.75 = 202.5 million
Southern: 165 million * 0.8 = 132 million
Eastern: 275 million * 0.8 = 220 million
Central: 125 million (no change)

Now, we add up the scaled back projections for all regions to get the total projected sales:

240 million (Northern) + 202.5 million (Western) + 132 million (Southern) + 220 million (Eastern) + 125 million (Central) = 919.5 million

The correct answer is C.

Step 1 -Work through each city shown calculating the number of under 15 year olds. Donot worry about entering the thousands in your calculator this just wastes time.
