The correct answer is A) A and B.",['inductive'],"B, D","The small square is replaced by a large square split in half, the bottom half of which is colored black (final figure number 1): Final figure number 2 designates a small square, the bottom half of which is also colored. For both the two basic figures, the lower part of the figure has therefore been colored black whereas the size has only been modified for the basic figure number 1. Since the common function figure is the hourglass, it can be deduced that its function is to color the lower half in black. Therefore, the diamond function must change the shape size. Consequently, the correct answer regarding the basic figure's appearance is answer D: the basic figure is a white circle. The function figure is that of the hourglass, whose function is to color the bottom half of the figure in black. Indeed, the final figure in D is a circle whose bottom half is colored black. Regarding the functional figure, the correct answer is answer B: the basic figure is a small white circle whereas the final figure is a large circle.

The first is that the circle moves counter-clockwise in the hexagon. It follows that, in the following diagram, the circle will be in the upper corner of the hexagon, pointing to D as the answer. To confirm this, the second rule can be applied, according to which the position of the black triangle alternates between bottom left and top right. Thus, in the following diagram, the black triangle will need to be in the upper right corner of the hex. The answer is therefore definitely D.",./images/v1_3.png

The cost of the permanent employees is not provided in the image, but we can assume that it is the same as the cost of the interim staff. Therefore, the total cost of the turnover would be £60,000 + the cost of the permanent employees.

Step 1- We are told that the total output from all fuels in 1996 is 200TWh, so we can work out what is was for coal in 1996. Coal in 1996 was 35% of 200TWh: 70TWh.

From this, the amount of brick and wood needed can be calculated along with information contained in the third statement. Double the area of glass is needed in brick and wood each. Glass = = 4m²    Brick = (4 * 2) = 8m²     Wood = (4 * 2) = 8m²     Metal = (8 * 0.5) = 4m²      Now, that the required quantities of materials have been obtained we can work out their pricing per square metre. Brick, as stated in the question is £100/m², whereas wood is £90/m², and metal is 4 times as expensive as wood (£90/m² * 4) = £360/m². Lastly, glass is 6 times more expensive than metal (£360/m² * 6) = £2,160/m².   Brick = 8m² * £100/m² = £800      Wood = 8m² * £90/m² = £720      Metal = 4m² * £360/m² = £1,440      Multiply the prices for the materials by the quantities needed to obtain a price for each material for the house being built. Lastly, sum these prices to compare with the figure of £11,000.   £8,640 + £800 + £720 + £1,440 = £11,600.  Therefore, the answer is false as the house with 4m² of glass does not cost less than £11,000.",./images/v1_302.png
