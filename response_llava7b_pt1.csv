    Question:
Based on the diagram at the top of the page, which two of the proposals A, B, C or D completes the diagrams at the bottom of the page?",The correct answer is: A and B.,['inductive'],"B, D","The small square is replaced by a large square split in half, the bottom half of which is colored black (final figure number 1): Final figure number 2 designates a small square, the bottom half of which is also colored. For both the two basic figures, the lower part of the figure has therefore been colored black whereas the size has only been modified for the basic figure number 1. Since the common function figure is the hourglass, it can be deduced that its function is to color the lower half in black. Therefore, the diamond function must change the shape size. Consequently, the correct answer regarding the basic figure's appearance is answer D: the basic figure is a white circle. The function figure is that of the hourglass, whose function is to color the bottom half of the figure in black. Indeed, the final figure in D is a circle whose bottom half is colored black. Regarding the functional figure, the correct answer is answer B: the basic figure is a small white circle whereas the final figure is a large circle. This is a result of the diamond figure; whose function is to enlarge the shape.",./images/v1_2.png

The first is that the circle moves counter-clockwise in the hexagon. It follows that, in the following diagram, the circle will be in the upper corner of the hexagon, pointing to D as the answer. To confirm this, the second rule can be applied, according to which the position of the black triangle alternates between bottom left and top right. Thus, in the following diagram, the black triangle will need to be in the upper right corner of the hex. The answer is therefore definitely D.",./images/v1_3.png

The image shows a table with four columns, each representing a different cost to buy the company's product. The table is divided into three sections, with each section showing the cost to buy the product in different currencies: Pounds (£), Dollars ($), and Euros (€). The table also displays the annual profit in each currency.

To achieve an annual profit of £39,000, the company would need to sell the product for at least 39,000 pounds. The table shows that the cost to buy the product in pounds is 39,000, which is the same as the annual profit. The cost to buy the product in dollars and euros is also 39,000, which is the same as the annual profit in each currency. Therefore, the correct answer is B, C, and D.",['numerical'],D,"Step 1- For company B, profit per employee is originally (£26,000 ÷ 8) = £3,250/employee.

Two FruitBars cost £1.50 without buying a BarBox. Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information","The correct answer is: A, B, C.",['deductive'],A,"Here are the necessary calculations, which require some algebra: Barbox, which can be written as B, Fruitbar = F, Oatbar = O = 1.75  A barbox is twice as expensive as 3 Fruitbars, hence, the following formula can be created:  B = 2 x (3F), which can be simplified to; B = 6F A second formula can be created as a Barbox combines two of each type of bar and is 0.50 cheaper than buying them individually:    B = 2F + 2O = 0.50   As B is equivalent to either equation, the two equations can be combined together to eliminate the algebraic variable; B. These are called simultaneous equations and are encountered at GCSE Maths.  6F = 2F + 2O - 0.50    Via a simple rearrangement and simplification of the equation we arrive at:  6F - 2F = 2O - 0.50  4F = 2O - 0.50  We know that an Oatbar is 1.75, hence two Oatbars (2O = 2 x 1.75) cost 3.50.  Therefore, following more rearrangements and simplifications;  4F = 3.50 - 0.50  4F = 3.00 F = 3.00/4  F = 0.75.",./images/v1_287.png

However, we are given the relationships between the bars sold: Barbox combines two of each (2 x Oatbars + 2 x Fruitbars). Half of Oatbar sales are sold through Barboxes.  If 2 are sold each time as part of the Barbox, and this represents half of the sales of Oatbars, then 4 oatbars are sold each time a Barbox purchase is made.     Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.     Thus, the answer to the question is True, also considering that sold implies that sales have been made, so, the sales figure must be greater than 0 and follow the relationships described above.",./images/v1_289.png

4. Glass costs less than £11,000.
5. A, B, and C are options.

The correct answer is: C. Insufficient Information.

The image does not provide enough information to determine the cost of the wood or the price of the house. The information provided only indicates that the house requires 4m² of glass and costs less than £11,000.",['deductive'],B,"First calculate the quantities needed of the materials. The first is easy as we are told in the question how much glass is required. From this, the amount of brick and wood needed can be calculated along with information contained in the third statement. Double the area of glass is needed in brick and wood each. Glass = = 4m²    Brick = (4 * 2) = 8m²     Wood = (4 * 2) = 8m²     Metal = (8 * 0.5) = 4m²      Now, that the required quantities of materials have been obtained we can work out their pricing per square metre. Brick, as stated in the question is £100/m², whereas wood is £90/m², and metal is 4 times as expensive as wood (£90/m² * 4) = £360/m². Lastly, glass is 6 times more expensive than metal (£360/m² * 6) = £2,160/m².   Brick = 8m² * £100/m² = £800      Wood = 8m² * £90/m² = £720      Metal = 4m² * £360/m² = £1,440      Multiply the prices for the materials by the quantities needed to obtain a price for each material for the house being built. Lastly, sum these prices to compare with the figure of £11,000.   £8,640 + £800 + £720 + £1,440 = £11,600.

This will be 2,483,400 x 1.012 = 2,513,200.8.  And we are told in the question that the R&D overheads are expected to increase by 1.1%. This will be 298,008 x 1.011 = 301,286.1.

Of the cities shown, which had the lowest number of people under the age of 15 at the start of the year 2000? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) Birmingham  (B) Glasgow (C) Liverpool (D) Leeds","The correct answer is: A, B, C, and D.",['numerical'],D," Tip -The question says of the cities shown. Without this technically we would have to respond cannot say because we are not told any information about any other cities and therefore we would not be able to say with any certainty which had the lowest number. As it happens in this question cannot say is not an option so we would have been OK, but its a catch worth looking out for.    Step 1 -Work through each city shown calculating the number of under 15 year olds. Donot worry about entering the thousands in your calculator this just wastes time.    London: donot bother calculating as it is not a possible answer.  Birmingham: 995 x 0.18 = 179.1   Glasgow: 600 x 0.21 = 126    Liverpool: 500 x 0.22 = 110   Leeds: 450 x 0.23 = 103.5    Thus the correct answer is (D) Leeds",./images/v1_366.png
