"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.

It follows that, in the following diagram, the circle will be in the upper corner of the hexagon, pointing to D as the answer. To confirm this, the second rule can be applied, according to which the position of the black triangle alternates between bottom left and top right. Thus, in the following diagram, the black triangle will need to be in the upper right corner of the hex. The answer is therefore definitely D.",./images/v1_3.png

2. The top right box has a question mark.
3. The bottom left box has a circle.

 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

The other letters do not resemble the cube in any way.",['inductive'],A,Rule 1: Each diamond takes it in turns to rotate 45 degrees clockwise each time.,./images/v1_29.png
"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.

 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.

 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.

Assuming profits in other areas remain the same, the Leisure profits missed this target by £1.8 million.",['numerical'],D,"Step 1- Calculate the total Reyes Heslop profits across all areas other than Leisure. (6.3 + 7.2 +5.0) + (3.8 + 5.8 + 4.4) + (3.6 + 5.9 + 4.5) + (6.2 +5.1 + 3.5) = 61.3million.  Step 2- This needs to be ¾ of all profits for the condition to be met. Therefore all profits, across all sectors, would be 61.3 ÷ 75% = 81.7333million. Step 3- Now we look at the difference between actual and target Leisure profits. Actual = (4.6 + 7.4  + 5.2) = 17.2 Target = (81.7333 – 61.3) = 20.4333 Shortfall = 3.2333 (millions) Thus the correct answer is (D) £3.2million ",./images/v1_61.png

Instruction Adherence: Fully Adhered

Usefulness: Highly Useful

Level of Detail: Very Detailed

Relevance: Highly Relevant

Answer: B",['numerical'],A,"Tip- If you read this quickly, it might be daunting. It needn’t be if you take each step at a time. Step 1- We are told that the total output from all fuels in 1996 is 200TWh, so we can work out what is was for coal in 1996. Coal in 1996 was 35% of 200TWh: 70TWh. So Nuclear in 2006 is twice this: 140TWh. Thus, the correct answer is (A) 140TWh",./images/v1_68.png

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

Step 1:  Identify from the table how many Wireless Headphones were produced in 2019. step 2:  Divide the number produced by 50 (the Headphones are sold in batches of 50). Step 3:  Multiply this number (i.e. the number of batches of 50) by the cost per batch of 50. note: You need to perform a separate calculation for each 'Grade' of Headphone becasue each batch of 50 costs a different amount: Grade A 2019 = 25,000 ÷ 50 × $500 = $250,000  Grade C 2019 = 80,000 ÷ 50 × $150 = $240,000  total = $490,000 Tip:  At the start of this queston you need to identify where the 2019 data is shown.

Given the context of the conversation and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.

Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.

Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. Instruction Adherence:
* Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
* Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
* Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
* Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.

Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”

2. Usefulness:
* Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
* Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
* Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
* Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.

Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”

3. Level of Detail:
* Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
* Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
* Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
* Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.

Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”

4. Relevance:
* Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
* Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
* Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
* Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.

Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”

Step 1:  Make sure you get the ration the correct way round.  Start by writing this down in a ratio format: Grade A : Grade C Step 2:  Calculate the value of the two classes of headphones: Grade A:    20,000 ÷ 50 × $500    =    $200,000 Grade C:    75,000 ÷ 50 × $150    =    $225,000 Step 3:  Write these values underneath the ratio you wrote down in step 1. Grade A : Grade C $200,000 : $225,000  Step 4:  Divide the first number by the second to calculate the ratio: $200,000 ÷ $225,000 = 0.8888  0.89:1 ",./images/v1_204.png

 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.

This conclusion is drawn from the statement ""No kalowites are kilowites"" and ""All kalowites are koliwites."" The statement ""No kalowites are kilowites"" implies that there is at least one kalowite that is not a kilowite, which means that some kalowites are indeed kilowites. The statement ""All kalowites are koliwites"" does not provide any information about the relationship between kalowites and kilowites, so it does not affect the conclusion.",['deductive'],B," The correct answer is B.

 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

Half of Oatbar sales are sold through Barboxes.  If 2 are sold each time as part of the Barbox, and this represents half of the sales of Oatbars, then 4 oatbars are sold each time a Barbox purchase is made.     Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.     Thus, the answer to the question is True, also considering that sold implies that sales have been made, so, the sales figure must be greater than 0 and follow the relationships described above.",./images/v1_289.png

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

From this, the amount of brick and wood needed can be calculated along with information contained in the third statement. Double the area of glass is needed in brick and wood each. Glass = = 4m²    Brick = (4 * 2) = 8m²     Wood = (4 * 2) = 8m²     Metal = (8 * 0.5) = 4m²      Now, that the required quantities of materials have been obtained we can work out their pricing per square metre. Brick, as stated in the question is £100/m², whereas wood is £90/m², and metal is 4 times as expensive as wood (£90/m² * 4) = £360/m². Lastly, glass is 6 times more expensive than metal (£360/m² * 6) = £2,160/m².   Brick = 8m² * £100/m² = £800      Wood = 8m² * £90/m² = £720      Metal = 4m² * £360/m² = £1,440      Multiply the prices for the materials by the quantities needed to obtain a price for each material for the house being built. Lastly, sum these prices to compare with the figure of £11,000.   £8,640 + £800 + £720 + £1,440 = £11,600.

\boxed{6, 6, 6}",A,['deductive'],C,">We are lacking the certainty of what a secretary produces. Sophie produces £8 an hour, but Andrea £10. Accountants produce £20 an hour. The passage doesn't tell us how much Secretaries make per hour. But we are told that Sophie makes £8 as a secretary, and Andrea £10 as a secretary. This doesn't mean all Secretaries make £10 an hour. Though we can say that all Accountants produce £20 an hour. With these figures, we could say that Accountants always produce twice the amount as Secretaries because whether it's £8 or £10, it's at least twice. HOWEVER, this is a false premise because the question statement refers to Secretaries, rather than, say Andrea or Sophie. Thus, we a lacking information into how much secretaries make.

 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

"You will have to answer a logical reasoning question, you will be shown an image and you will have to answer the multiple choice question related to it.","You are a skilled little expert at scoring responses. You should evaluate given responses based on the given judging criteria.
 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:
 - Highly Relevant (9-10 points): The response is highly relevant to the question, with information closely aligned with the topic.
 - Generally Relevant (6-8 points): The response is generally relevant but includes some unnecessary information.
 - Partially Relevant (3-5 points): The response has a lot of content that deviates from the topic.
 - Not Relevant (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant.
 Example: If the response strays from the topic but still provides some relevant information, it falls under “Partially Relevant.”#### Conversation Context ####

Note 2: To get the correct percentage calculation think about a 0.8% drop from the 2008 figure to the 2009 figure. We would say [2008 figure] x 0.992 = [2009 figure]. We have calculated the 2009 figure to be 2,483,400 so by rearranging we can find 2008.

This will be 2,483,400 x 1.012 = 2,513,200.8.  And we are told in the question that the R&D overheads are expected to increase by 1.1%. This will be 298,008 x 1.011 = 301,286.1.   Step 4- So the available R&D money left after overheads is (2,513,200.8 minus 301,286.1) = 2,211,914.7.   Thus the correct answer is (D) 2.21 million",./images/v1_339.png

 Given the context of the conversation (the last round is the User’s query) and multiple responses from the Assistant, you need to refer to the [General Evaluation Criteria] to score the responses. Based on the general evaluation criteria, state potential other specific criteria to the query, the weights of different criteria, and then provide an overall comprehensive score upon them.
 Each score is an integer between 1 and 10, with a higher score indicating that the response meets the relevant criteria more closely. For example, a score of 1 means the response does not meet the criteria at all, a score of 6 means the response meets only some parts, and a score of 10 means the response perfectly meets the evaluation criteria.
 Before scoring, please analyze step by step. Your scoring needs to be as strict as possible#### Evaluation Criteria #### 1. Instruction Adherence:
 - Fully Adhered (9-10 points): The response fully complies with all instructions and requirements of the question.
 - Partially Adhered (6-8 points): The response meets most of the instructions but has some omissions or misunderstandings.
 - Basically Adhered (3-5 points): The response meets some instructions, but the main requirements are not fulfilled.
 - Not Adhered (1-2 points): The response does not meet any instructions.
 Example: If the question requires three examples and the response provides only one, it falls under “Partially Adhered.”2. Usefulness:
 - Highly Useful (9-10 points): The response provides comprehensive and accurate information, fully addressing the issue.
 - Useful but Incomplete (6-8 points): The response provides some useful information, but lacks details or accuracy.
 - Limited Usefulness (3-5 points): The response offers little useful information, with most content being irrelevant or incorrect.
 - Useless or Incorrect (1-2 points): The response is completely irrelevant or incorrect.
 Example: If there are factual errors in the response but the overall direction is correct, it falls under “Useful but Incomplete.”3. Level of Detail:
 - Very Detailed (9-10 points): The response includes ample details covering all aspects of the issue.
 - Detailed but Slightly Lacking (6-8 points): The response is fairly detailed but misses some important details.
 - Basically Detailed (3-5 points): The response provides some details but is not thorough enough overall.
 - Not Detailed (1-2 points): The response is very brief and lacks necessary details.
 Example: If the response provides only a simple conclusion without an explanation, it falls under “Not Detailed.”4. Relevance:

As it happens in this question cannot say is not an option so we would have been OK, but its a catch worth looking out for.    Step 1 -Work through each city shown calculating the number of under 15 year olds. Donot worry about entering the thousands in your calculator this just wastes time.    London: donot bother calculating as it is not a possible answer.
