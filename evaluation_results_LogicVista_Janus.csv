Step 1: Analyze the given image
The image consists of a sequence of boxes, each containing a black circle and a black triangle. The boxes are arranged in a specific order.

Step 2: Identify the pattern
Upon analyzing the image, I notice that each box contains a black circle and a black triangle. The triangles are positioned in different orientations, and the circles are placed in the center of the triangles.

Step 3: Determine the sequence
Based on the pattern observed, I can determine that the sequence of boxes is as follows:
- First box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing up
- Second box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing right
- Third box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing down
- Fourth box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing left
- Fifth box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing up
- Sixth box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing right
- Seventh box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing down
- Eighth box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing left
- Ninth box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing up
- Tenth box: Black circle in the center, black triangle pointing right

Now, let's look at the second row. The first box has two circles and two squares, the second box has two circles and one triangle, the third box has two squares and one triangle, and the fourth box has one circle and one square.

Again, the pattern is that each box contains a combination of shapes that are not repeated in the same row.

Based on this pattern, the next box in the sequence should contain a combination of shapes that are not repeated in the same row.

Looking at the options A-E, the box that comes next in the sequence is the one that contains a combination of shapes that are not repeated in the same row.

The correct answer is: E.","The sequence in the image follows a pattern where each box contains a set of shapes that are different from the previous box. The shapes in each box are arranged in a specific order. By analyzing the pattern, we can determine that the box with the question mark should contain the shapes in the same order as the previous boxes, which leads us to option A.

Answer: A.","To solve this task, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of images.

First, let's analyze the given images:

1. The first image has a circle, square, and triangle.
2. The second image has a circle, square, and triangle.
3. The third image has a circle, square, and triangle.
4. The fourth image has a circle, square, and triangle.
5. The fifth image has a circle, square, and triangle.
6. The sixth image has a circle, square, and triangle.
7. The seventh image has a circle, square, and triangle.
8. The eighth image has a circle, square, and triangle.
9. The ninth image has a circle, square, and triangle.
10. The tenth image has a circle, square, and triangle.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. Circle, square, triangle
B. Circle, square, triangle
C. Circle, square, triangle
D. Circle, square, triangle
E. Circle, square, triangle

The pattern in the sequence is that each image has a circle, square, and triangle. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The correct answer is: A,B,C,D,E",['inductive'],D,Shapes are not in a set position within this sequence. It is merely the presence of the shapes that is important. 1. There are always two squares in the frame. 2. There are always two circles in the frame. 3. There is always one triangle in the frame. So the answer is D).,./images/v1_22.png

The first row shows a sequence of shapes with increasing complexity, while the second row shows a similar sequence but with different shapes.

The pattern seems to be that each shape in the second row is a combination of the shapes in the first row. The first shape in the second row is a combination of the first and second shapes in the first row, the second shape is a combination of the second and third shapes, and so on.

Based on this pattern, the missing shape should be a combination of the first and second shapes in the first row. The first shape in the first row is a circle with four arms, and the second shape is a circle with five arms. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Let's think step-by-step:
1. Observe the shapes in the image and note the pattern of dots around each shape.
2. Compare the shapes in the options A-E with the shapes in the image to find the one that matches the pattern.
3. Select the option that fits the pattern and replace the question mark with it.

After analyzing the image and the options, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is: A.","The pattern in the image above the line consists of a series of shapes with dots around them. The shapes vary in their orientation and the number of dots. The task is to find the option that fits the pattern.

Looking at the options A-E, the first row shows a sequence of shapes with dots around them. The second row shows the same shapes but with different orientations.

To find the correct option, we need to identify the pattern in the first row and apply it to the second row.

- The first shape in the first row is a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it.
- The second shape in the first row is a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it.
- The third shape in the first row is a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it.
- The fourth shape in the first row is a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it.
- The fifth shape in the first row is a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it.

The pattern in the first row is a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it. The second row should follow the same pattern.

Option A has a shape with a small upward-facing triangle and dots around it, which matches the pattern in the first row.

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

1. We need to determine the amount of money Kim Ramirez has remaining from the original sale after purchasing Instant.
2. We know that Kim Ramirez sold five paintings: Painting I, Painting II, Painting III, Painting IV, and Painting V.
3. We also know the prices of the paintings: Painting I is £10,000, Painting II is £7,000, Painting III is £6,000, Painting IV is £4,500, and Painting V is £17,500.
4. To find out how much money she has remaining, we need to subtract the price of the painting she purchased (Instant) from the total amount of money she had before purchasing it.

Now, let's calculate the remaining amount:

- Total amount of money before purchasing Instant = £10,000 (Painting I) + £7,000 (Painting II) + £6,000 (Painting III) + £4,500 (Painting IV) + £17,500 (Painting V) = £45,000

- Painting IV: £4,500
- Painting V: £17,500

To find out how much money she has remaining, we need to subtract the total amount she spent on the paintings from the original sale price.

Total amount spent on the paintings:
£10,000 (Painting I) + £7,000 (Painting II) + £6,000 (Painting III) + £4,500 (Painting IV) + £17,500 (Painting V) = £43,050

First, we need to calculate the highest and lowest price for each company over the last 12 months.

- For Huver Co.:
  - Highest price: 1,360
  - Lowest price: 860

- For Drebs Ltd.:
  - Highest price: 22
  - Lowest price: 11

- For Fevs Plc.:

- For Fauvers:
  - Highest price: 724
  - Lowest price: 464

- For Steapars:
  - Highest price: 2,630
  - Lowest price: 2,216

Next, we need to find the difference between the highest and lowest price for each company.

- For Huver Co.:
  - Difference: 1,360 - 860 = 500

- For Drebs Ltd.:
  - Difference: 22 - 11 = 11

- For Fevs Plc.:
  - Difference: 1,955 - 1,242 = 713

- For Fauvers:
  - Difference: 724 - 464 = 260

- For Steapars:
  - Difference: 2,630 - 2,216 = 414

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is asking for the Drebs Ltd share price a month ago.

Step 2: Use the given information.
The image shows that the Drebs Ltd share price today is €18, which is a 40% increase from the price one month ago.

Step 3: Calculate the price a month ago.
If the price today is €18, and it represents a 40% increase from the price one month ago, we can calculate the price a month ago by dividing the current price by 1.40.

Price a month ago = €18 / 1.40 = €12.86

The correct answer is: €12.86.","To find the Drebs Ltd share price a month ago, we need to calculate the percentage change from the previous day's price. The change is 40%, so we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Price a month ago} = \text{Today's Price} \times (1 - \text{Percentage Change}) \]

Given:
- Today's Price = €18
- Percentage Change = 40%

Substitute these values into the equation:

\[ \text{Price a month ago} = €18 \times (1 - 0.40) \]

\[ \text{Price a month ago} = €18 \times 0.60 \]

\[ \text{Price a month ago} = €10.80 \]

Therefore, the Drebs Ltd share price a month ago was €10.80.

The correct answer is (C) €10.80.","Let's think step-by-step.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is asking for the Drebs Ltd share price a month ago.

Step 2: Use the given information.
The image shows that the Drebs Ltd share price today is €18 and it represents a 40% increase on the price one month ago.

Step 3: Calculate the price a month ago.
To find the price a month ago, we need to calculate 40% of the current price (€18) and subtract it from the current price.

40% of €18 = 0.40 * €18 = €7.20

So, the price a month ago was €18 - €7.20 = €10.80.

Step 4: Choose the correct answer.
The correct answer is: €10.80.",['numerical'],E,Step 1- Drebs Ltd’s share price is shown as 18 Euros at today’s prices. This is a 40% increase and so represents 1.40 (140%) of the price one month ago. Step 2- The price one month ago is calculated as follows: 18 ÷ 1.40 = 12.86.

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

1. The question asks for the predicted annual consumption of fuel for a driver who travels an average of 4,250 miles per month driving only along motorways in an Xtam car.
2. The image shows a bar graph comparing fuel consumption (in miles to the gallon) for different cars (Tabel, Ursa, Velo, Tink, Xtam) under two driving conditions: City driving and Motorway driving.
3. The driver's monthly consumption is given as 4,250 miles, which is equivalent to 4,250 miles / 12 months = 354.17 miles per month.
4. To find the annual consumption, we multiply the monthly consumption by 12.
5. The bar graph shows that the Xtam car has a fuel consumption of 110 miles to the gallon for Motorway driving.
6. Therefore, the annual consumption for the Xtam car is 110 miles/gallon * 12 months = 1,320 gallons.

The correct answer is: E. 1,320.","To find the predicted annual consumption of fuel for the Xtam car, we need to multiply the monthly consumption by the number of months in a year.

Taber: 65 mph, £12,500
Ursa: 60 mph, £12,500

The GCD of 65 and 60 is 5.

4. Since the dealership wants to buy equal numbers of the Taber and Ursa cars, we divide the total budget by the GCD to find the number of each car model:

   - Cost to purchase: £12,500

2. Calculate the total number of Ursa cars:
   - Maximum speed: 60 mph

   - Number of Ursa cars: £120,000 / £12,500 = 9.2

Since we cannot order a fraction of a car, we round down to the nearest whole number.

6. Round down to the nearest whole number:

   - £46,200 (annual cost for interim staff) - £166,000 (annual cost for permanent staff) = £119,800

Therefore, the effect on labour costs would be an increase of £119,800.

The correct answer is D) Increase of £119,800.","The correct answer is: C. Decrease of £20,750.

Explanation:
The original labour costs for the permanent employees would have been £166,000. If they replaced 20 permanent employees with interim staff, the labour costs would have been £166,000 - £20,750 = £145,250. This is a decrease of £20,750 compared to the original labour costs.",['numerical'],E,"Step 1– Calculate the monthly cost of each full-time employee in January 166,000 / 80 = 2,075.

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

1. The ratio of profit to turnover for Pacific Rim contracts is 2:15.
2. This means that for every £2 of profit, there are £15 of turnover.
3. To find the turnover, we can multiply the profit by the ratio.

Turnover = Profit * Ratio
Turnover = 2 * 15
Turnover = 30

The correct answer is: 30.","To find the Government turnover in the Pacific Rim, we need to use the given ratio of profit to turnover, which is 2:15. This means that for every £2 of profit, there are £15 of turnover.

Let's denote the Government turnover as \( x \).

The ratio can be expressed as:
\[ \frac{\text{Government turnover}}{x} = \frac{2}{15} \]

Cross-multiplying gives us:
\[ 15 \times \text{Government turnover} = 2 \times x \]

\[ \text{Government turnover} = \frac{2 \times x}{15} \]

We are given that the Government turnover is £360.

\[ 360 = \frac{2 \times x}{15} \]

Multiplying both sides by 15 to solve for \( x \):
\[ 5400 = 2 \times x \]

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[ x = 270 \]

Therefore, the Government turnover in the Pacific Rim was £270, which corresponds to option (C).

The correct answer is: C","Let's think step-by-step.

1. First, we need to find the total profit for Pacific Rim contracts.
2. We know that the profit is 2 parts out of every 15 parts of turnover.
3. To find the total turnover, we can set up a proportion:

   Profit / Turnover = 2 / 15

4. We can cross-multiply to solve for Turnover:

   Profit * 15 = 2 * Turnover

5. Now, we can solve for Turnover:

   Turnover = (2 * Profit) / 15

6. We are given the turnover for Leisure and Manufacturing, so we can add those up:

   Leisure Turnover = 5.2
   Manufacturing Turnover = 5.0

7. Now, we can add the Turnover for Leisure and Manufacturing:

   Total Turnover (Leisure + Manufacturing) = 5.2 + 5.0 = 10.2

8. We can now use the total turnover to find the Government turnover:

   Government Turnover = (2 * Total Profit) / 15

9. We are given the total profit for Pacific Rim contracts, so we can substitute that in:

   Government Turnover = (2 * 6.3) / 15

10. Now, we can solve for Government Turnover:

    Government Turnover = (12.6) / 15

11. Finally, we can simplify the fraction:

    Government Turnover = 0.84

The correct answer is: B. 270.",['numerical'],C,"Step 1- Contracts ratio of profit (£3.6million) to turnover = 2:15 Turnover = £3.6 million x 15/2 = £27 million = 270 (in £100,000s) Thus the correct answer is (C) 270 ",./images/v1_60.png

The correct answer is: B.","To determine by how much the Leisure profits missed the target, we need to calculate the difference between the target and the actual Leisure profits.

The target is a quarter of the total profits, which is:

\[ \text{Target} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total Profits} \]

Given that the total profits for Leisure are £7.4 million, the target is:

\[ \text{Target} = \frac{1}{4} \times 7.4 = 1.85 \text{ million} \]

The actual Leisure profits are £7.2 million.

The difference between the target and the actual Leisure profits is:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Target} - \text{Actual} = 1.85 - 7.2 = -5.35 \text{ million} \]

This negative value indicates that the Leisure profits are below the target.

The closest answer choice to this calculation is:

(A) £1.8 million",The correct answer is: C.,['numerical'],D,"Step 1- Calculate the total Reyes Heslop profits across all areas other than Leisure. (6.3 + 7.2 +5.0) + (3.8 + 5.8 + 4.4) + (3.6 + 5.9 + 4.5) + (6.2 +5.1 + 3.5) = 61.3million.  Step 2- This needs to be ¾ of all profits for the condition to be met. Therefore all profits, across all sectors, would be 61.3 ÷ 75% = 81.7333million. Step 3- Now we look at the difference between actual and target Leisure profits. Actual = (4.6 + 7.4  + 5.2) = 17.2 Target = (81.7333 – 61.3) = 20.4333 Shortfall = 3.2333 (millions) Thus the correct answer is (D) £3.2million ",./images/v1_61.png

1. The Eastern Region's sales represent 26% of the total sales across all regions.
2. To find the total sales across all regions, we can set up a proportion.
3. Let the total sales across all regions be T.
4. Then, 26% of T is equal to the Eastern Region's sales.
5. We can write this as: 0.26 * T = Eastern Region's sales.
6. To find T, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.26: T = Eastern Region's sales / 0.26.
7. Now, we can calculate the total sales across all regions by multiplying the Eastern Region's sales by 0.26: T = Eastern Region's sales * 0.26.
8. We are given that the Eastern Region's sales are £142 million.
9. So, T = £142 million * 0.26.
10. Calculating this, we get T = £36.76 million.

26% of £124 million = 0.26 * £124 million = £32.24 million

Now, we need to find the total sales across all regions. We can do this by adding the sales of all the regions:

Total sales = Eastern Region sales + Telesales sales + Direct Sales sales

We know the Eastern Region sales is £124 million, and we need to find the other two sales.

Assuming the other two regions have the same sales as the Eastern Region:

Total sales = £124 million + £124 million + £124 million = £362 million

So, the total sales across all regions (to the nearest £million) is £362 million.

The answer is (C) £161 million.","Let's think step-by-step:

1. We know that the Eastern Region's sales represent 26% of the total sales across all regions.
2. To find the total sales across all regions, we can set up a proportion: Eastern Region's sales / Total sales = 26%
3. We can rewrite this proportion as: Eastern Region's sales = 26% * Total sales
4. We are given that the Eastern Region's sales are £161 million.
5. We can substitute this value into the proportion: £161 million = 26% * Total sales
6. We can solve for Total sales by dividing both sides by 26%: Total sales = £161 million / 26%
7. We can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: Total sales = £161 million / 0.26
8. We can calculate the total sales by multiplying £161 million by 0.26: Total sales = £41 million

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to determine the profit per employee for each company. We can do this by dividing the annual profit by the number of employees.

For Company A:
Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = 20,000 / 5 = 4,000

For Company B:
Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = 25,000 / 8 = 3,125

For Company C:
Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = 20,000 / 8 = 2,500

For Company D:
Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = 30,000 / 18 = 16,667

Now, we need to determine how many extra employees Company B would need to recruit to achieve annual profits of £39,000.

Let's assume that Company B currently has x employees.

The current profit per employee for Company B is 3,125.

The desired profit per employee for Company B is 4,000.

The difference in profit per employee is 4,000 - 3,125 = 875.

To achieve the desired profit per employee, Company B would need to recruit x + y employees.

The total desired profit is 39,000.

The total desired profit per employee is 4,000.

The total desired profit is the product of the total desired profit and the total desired profit per employee.

39,000 = (x + y) * 4,000

Now, we can solve for y:

y = (39,000 / 4,000) - x

y = 9.75 - x

Since we cannot have a fraction of an employee, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

y = 10 - x

Now, we can plug in the values for x and y:

For Company B:
x = 8
y = 10 - 8 = 2

The correct answer is: B,2.","To determine how many extra employees Company B would need to recruit to achieve annual profits of £39,000, we first need to calculate the profit per employee for each company.

1. **Calculate the profit per employee for Company A:**
   - Annual profit: £20,000
   - Number of employees: 5
   - Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = £20,000 / 5 = £4,000

2. **Calculate the profit per employee for Company B:**
   - Annual profit: £26,000
   - Number of employees: 8
   - Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = £26,000 / 8 = £3,250

3. **Calculate the profit per employee for Company C:**
   - Annual profit: £21,000
   - Number of employees: 8
   - Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = £21,000 / 8 = £2,625

4. **Calculate the profit per employee for Company D:**
   - Annual profit: £30,000
   - Number of employees: 18
   - Profit per employee = Annual profit / Number of employees = £30,000 / 18 = £1,667

5. **Determine the difference in profit per employee between Company B and the target:**
   - Difference = Profit per employee for Company B - Target profit per employee = £3,250 - £1,667 = £1,583

6. **Calculate the number of extra employees needed:**
   - Number of extra employees = Difference / Profit per employee = £1,583 / £3,250 = 0.48

Since the number of employees must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Company B would need to recruit 1 extra employee to achieve annual profits of £39,000.

The answer is (B) 3.","To solve this problem, we need to determine the profit per employee for each company and then calculate how many extra employees Company B would need to recruit to achieve the desired annual profits.

1. Calculate the profit per employee for each company:
   - Company A: \( \frac{20,000}{5} = 4,000 \)
   - Company B: \( \frac{25,000}{8} = 3,125 \)
   - Company C: \( \frac{20,000}{8} = 2,500 \)
   - Company D: \( \frac{30,000}{18} = 1,667 \)

2. Determine the desired annual profits:
   - Company B: £39,000

3. Calculate the number of extra employees needed for Company B:
   - Number of extra employees = Desired annual profits - Current profit per employee
   - Number of extra employees = \( 39,000 - 3,125 = 35,875 \)

   - A) 6
   - B) 3
   - C) 12
   - D) 4

The correct answer is: B",['numerical'],D,"Step 1- For company B, profit per employee is originally (£26,000 ÷ 8) = £3,250/employee.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of unemployed people by dividing the number of unemployed people by the total number of people sampled and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of unemployed people = (Number of unemployed people / Total number of people sampled) * 100

Percentage of unemployed people = (52,000 / 1,345,000) * 100

Percentage of unemployed people = 0.0383 or 3.83%

Step 1- We are told that the total output from all fuels in 1996 is 200TWh, so we can work out what is was for coal in 1996. Coal in 1996 was 35% of 200TWh: 70TWh. So Nuclear in 2006 is twice this: 140TWh. Thus, the correct answer is (A) 140TWh",./images/v1_68.png

The image shows two sets of shapes. Set A consists of five shapes, each with a different number of sides. Set B consists of six shapes, each with a different number of sides. The shapes in Set A are pentagons, triangles, and quadrilaterals, while the shapes in Set B are pentagons, triangles, quadrilaterals, and a pentagon.

The figure in question is a square, which has four sides.

Based on the analysis, the figure belongs to Set B.

The correct answer is: B.","The Figure belongs to Set A. The reason is that the Figure is a square with a smaller square inside it, and this matches the pattern of Set A, where each shape is surrounded by another shape of the same type but with a different number of sides. In Set A, the shapes are all polygons with a smaller polygon inside them, while in Set B, the shapes are all polygons with a different number of sides.","To answer this question, let's think step-by-step:

1. First, we need to understand the context of the image. The image shows two sets of shapes, labeled as Set A and Set B, along with a figure that we need to determine which set it belongs to.

2. Next, we should analyze the shapes in Set A and Set B. Set A consists of a series of shapes with increasing complexity, while Set B consists of shapes with varying orientations.

3. Now, we need to compare the figure with the shapes in Set A and Set B. The figure appears to be a square with a smaller square inside it, which is a shape that can be found in both Set A and Set B.

4. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that the figure belongs to Set A.

The image shows two sets of shapes. Set A consists of a T-shaped figure, a T-shaped figure, a right-angled L-shaped figure, and a T-shaped figure. Set B consists of a T-shaped figure, a T-shaped figure, a right-angled L-shaped figure, and a T-shaped figure.

Comparing the shapes in both sets, it is clear that the shapes in Set A are different from the shapes in Set B.

Based on the comparison, the image belongs to Set B.

The correct answer is: B.","The answer is B. The figure shown in the image belongs to Set B. This can be determined by comparing the shapes and orientations of the objects in the figure with those in Set B. The figure in Set B has the same orientation and shape as the objects in Set B, which makes it a part of Set B.",The correct answer is: B. The figure belongs to Set B.,['inductive'],A,"Set A:    In each box, the horizontal bar is longer than the vertical bar.     Set B:    In each box, the vertical bar is longer than the horizontal bar.  Figure:   The horizontal bar is longer than the vertical bar.",./images/v1_105.png

First, we need to understand the task. The task is to identify the correct diagram that replaces the question mark in the given image.

The image shows a series of symbols and transformations. We need to find the pattern and apply it to the question mark.

Looking at the first part of the image, we see that the middle symbol changes its size. The second part of the image shows that half-size symbols are replaced with full-size circles.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the question mark. The question mark is a blank box. We need to find a symbol that fits the pattern of changing sizes and replacing half-size symbols with full-size circles.

The only option that fits this pattern is option B, which shows a triangle and a circle.

The correct answer is: B.","The diagram that replaces the question mark is (B). The explanation is as follows:

- The first part of the image shows a sequence of transformations for the middle symbol.
- The second part of the image shows a sequence of transformations for the first and third symbols.
- The question mark represents the transformation of the first and third symbols.
- Option (B) shows a triangle and a circle, which matches the transformation shown in the second part of the image.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B).","Let's think step-by-step.

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to understand what objects are typically associated with floating or not floating on water.

A banana is a fruit, and fruits are generally not made of materials that are good at floating on water.

A scissors is a tool, and tools are usually not made of materials that are good at floating on water.

An empty plastic soda bottle is a container, and containers are usually not made of materials that are good at floating on water.

A wooden pencil is a writing instrument, and writing instruments are usually not made of materials that are good at floating on water.

Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is: A, B, C, and D.","The correct answer is D: wooden pencil.

Explanation:
- A banana floats on water because it is buoyant and has a low density compared to water.
- Scissors also float on water because they are made of metal and have a low density compared to water.
- An empty plastic soda bottle floats on water because it is made of plastic and has a low density compared to water.
- A wooden pencil does not float on water because it is made of wood and has a higher density than water. This means that the weight of the water displaced by the pencil is greater than the weight of the pencil itself, causing it to sink.","Which of these objects will not float on water?

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to understand what acceleration is. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object. It is the change in velocity of an object over time.

Now, let's analyze each option:

A) Total weight of the vehicle, including occupants and luggage: The weight of the vehicle and its contents affects its acceleration. The heavier the vehicle, the more force is needed to accelerate it, which would decrease its acceleration.

B) Power output from the vehicle engine: Power output is the rate at which energy is transferred to the vehicle. If the engine is powerful, it can accelerate the vehicle more quickly.

C) Drag coefficient of the vehicle: The drag coefficient is a measure of how much of the vehicle's speed is lost due to air resistance. A higher drag coefficient means more air resistance, which would slow down the vehicle's acceleration.

D) All are correct: This option suggests that all the factors mentioned could affect the rate of acceleration.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: A,B.","The correct answer is D. All are correct. 

Explanation:
- **Total weight of the vehicle, including occupants and luggage (A)**: The weight of the vehicle, including occupants and luggage, directly affects the rate of acceleration. A heavier vehicle will require more force to accelerate to the same speed as a lighter vehicle.
- **Power output from the vehicle engine (B)**: The power output from the vehicle's engine is crucial for acceleration. A vehicle with a higher power output can accelerate faster than one with a lower power output.
- **Drag coefficient of the vehicle (C)**: The drag coefficient measures how much of the vehicle's speed is lost due to air resistance. A lower drag coefficient means less resistance, allowing the vehicle to accelerate more quickly.

Therefore, all three factors (A, B, and C) can directly affect the rate of acceleration of a vehicle.","Let's think step-by-step.

Step 1: Analyze the options given.

Option A: Total weight of the vehicle, including occupants and luggage
- This option considers the weight of the vehicle and its occupants, which is a factor in determining the rate of acceleration.

Option B: Power output from the vehicle engine
- This option considers the engine's power output, which is a factor in determining the rate of acceleration.

Option C: Drag coefficient of the vehicle
- This option considers the drag coefficient, which is a factor in determining the rate of acceleration.

Option D: All are correct
- This option suggests that all the given factors might directly affect the rate of acceleration.

Step 2: Evaluate the options.

Option A: Total weight of the vehicle, including occupants and luggage
- This option is correct because the weight of the vehicle and its occupants affects the rate of acceleration.

Option B: Power output from the vehicle engine
- This option is correct because the power output from the engine affects the rate of acceleration.

Option C: Drag coefficient of the vehicle
- This option is correct because the drag coefficient affects the rate of acceleration.

Step 3: Determine the correct answer.

Step 2: Extract the data for 2019.
From the graph, we can see that the price for Grade A in 2019 was $800 per 50 units.

Step 3: Calculate the total value of Grade A and C for 2019.
The total value of Grade A and C for 2019 is the sum of their prices:
Total value = Price of Grade A + Price of Grade C
Total value = $800 + $160
Total value = $960

Step 4: Select the correct answer.
The correct answer is: 960.","To find the total value of Grade A and C Wireless Headphones produced in 2019, we need to add the values of the two grades from the graph.

\[ \frac{\text{Algiers' precipitation}}{\text{Stockholm's precipitation}} = \frac{100}{60} \]

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 20.

\[ \frac{100}{60} = \frac{100 \div 20}{60 \div 20} = \frac{5}{3} \]

The correct answer is: 3:1.","To find the ratio of precipitation levels in April for Algiers to Stockholm, we need to compare the height of the blue bar (Algiers) and the blue bar (Stockholm) in the graph for April.

- The height of the blue bar for Algiers in April is approximately 60.
- The height of the blue bar for Stockholm in April is approximately 30.

The ratio of Algiers' precipitation to Stockholm's precipitation is:

\[ \frac{60}{30} = 2 \]

Therefore, the ratio of level of precipitation in April of Algiers to Stockholm in its simplest form is 2:1.

The answer is C.","You will be shown an image, you will have to answer the question related to the image.

1. The image shows a bar graph comparing snowfall in Whistler, Las Arcs, Tignes, and Val Thorens for the months of January, February, November, and December.
2. The bars represent the snowfall in cm for each location and month.
3. To find the percentage increase in snowfall from November to December, we need to calculate the difference in snowfall between the two months and then divide by the snowfall in November.

Now, let's calculate the snowfall for each location in November and December:
- Whistler: 30 cm (November) and 35 cm (December)
- Las Arcs: 10 cm (November) and 15 cm (December)
- Tignes: 15 cm (November) and 20 cm (December)
- Val Thorens: 10 cm (November) and 15 cm (December)

Next, we'll calculate the percentage increase:
- Whistler: (35 - 30) / 30 * 100 = 16.67%
- Las Arcs: (15 - 10) / 10 * 100 = 50%
- Tignes: (20 - 15) / 15 * 100 = 33.33%
- Val Thorens: (15 - 10) / 10 * 100 = 50%

The correct answer is: B,50%.","To determine the percentage increase in snowfall from November to December in Whistler, we need to look at the bar lengths for both months. 

- November: The bar length is approximately 35 cm.
- December: The bar length is approximately 45 cm.

The increase in snowfall is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Snowfall}}{\text{Original Snowfall}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{45 - 35}{35} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{10}{35} \right) \times 100 = 28.57\% \]

Therefore, the percentage increase in snowfall in Whistler from November to December is approximately 28.57%.

The correct answer is (A) 30%.",The correct answer is: B. 40%.,['numerical'],C, The correct answer is C. Step 1:  Identify how much snow fell in Whistler in November and December:  Nov = 20cm  Dec = 30cm     Step 2:  Calculate the difference between the two amounts: 30cm -20cm = 10cm  Step 3:  Divide the difference by the November figure 'the old figure' and multiply by 100. 10cm / 20cm x 100 = 50%  Tip:  To calculate percentage increase quickly:  Subtract the newest figure from the oldest figure and divide by the oldest. ,./images/v1_215.png

1. We need to find the snowfall for December in each resort.
2. We need to calculate the snowfall for January based on the changes in snowfall for December.
3. We need to add up the snowfall for January in all resorts.

For Val Thorens and Whistler:
- December snowfall = 30 cm
- January snowfall increase = 20% of 30 cm = 0.20 * 30 = 6 cm
- January snowfall = 30 cm + 6 cm = 36 cm

For Tignes and Les Arcs:
- December snowfall = 30 cm
- January snowfall decrease = 15% of 30 cm = 0.15 * 30 = 4.5 cm
- January snowfall = 30 cm - 4.5 cm = 25.5 cm

- Total snowfall = 36 cm + 25.5 cm = 61.5 cm

The correct answer is: B. 115.5cm","To solve this problem, we need to calculate the snowfall for each resort in January based on the given percentages.

1. **Val Thorens**:
   - January snowfall = December snowfall × 1.20

2. **Whistler**:
   - January snowfall = December snowfall × 1.15
   - January snowfall = 35 cm × 1.15 = 40.25 cm

3. **Tignes**:
   - January snowfall = December snowfall × 0.85
   - January snowfall = 35 cm × 0.85 = 29.75 cm

4. **Les Arcs**:
   - January snowfall = December snowfall × 0.80
   - January snowfall = 35 cm × 0.80 = 28 cm

Now, we add the snowfall for all resorts to find the total snowfall for January:

- Total snowfall = Val Thorens + Whistler + Tignes + Les Arcs
- Total snowfall = 42 cm + 40.25 cm + 29.75 cm + 28 cm
- Total snowfall = 130.75 cm

From the first statement, we can infer that all dolphins are a subset of whales.

From the second statement, we can infer that there are no whales that are specifically sperm whales.

Now, let's consider the logical conclusion that can be drawn from these statements.

If all dolphins are whales, and there are no whales that are specifically sperm whales, then it is logical to conclude that no dolphins are sperm whales.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The correct answer is: D. No dolphins are sperm whales.","The logical conclusion that can be drawn from the given statements is: 

(B) No whales are dolphins.

This conclusion is based on the fact that the first statement says ""All dolphins are whales,"" which contradicts the second statement that says ""No whales are dolphins."" Therefore, the logical conclusion is that there are no dolphins that are also whales.","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to determine if the two statements are logically consistent.

Statement 1: ""All dolphins are whales""
Statement 2: ""No whales are sperm whales""

We can analyze these statements as follows:

- If Statement 1 is true, then all dolphins must be whales.
- If Statement 2 is true, then no whales can be sperm whales.

Now, let's analyze the relationship between the two statements:

- If Statement 1 is true, then Statement 2 must be false.
- If Statement 2 is true, then Statement 1 must be false.

Therefore, the two statements are logically inconsistent.

The correct answer is: (D) No dolphins are whales.",['deductive'],C, The correct answer is C. ,./images/v1_232.png

First, we need to understand the statements given:
- All birds are crows
- No ravens are crows

From the first statement, we know that all birds are crows. This means that if there are birds, they must be crows.

From the second statement, we know that no ravens are crows. This means that if there are crows, they cannot be ravens.

Now, let's analyze the options:
A) Some ravens are birds: This statement contradicts the second statement, which says that no ravens are crows.
B) No crows are birds: This statement contradicts the first statement, which says that all birds are crows.
C) No ravens are birds: This statement contradicts the second statement, which says that no ravens are crows.
D) All ravens are crows: This statement is consistent with both statements, as it says that all ravens are crows, which is true according to the first statement.

The correct answer is: D. All ravens are crows.","The logical conclusion that can be drawn from the two statements is: (A) Some ravens are birds.

This statement implies that all happy tunes are beautiful sounds.

Now, let's analyze the possible answers.

A: ""All beautiful sounds are happy tunes""
This statement is not logical because it contradicts Statement 1. If all beautiful sounds are happy tunes, then they would not be annoying.

Step 4: Determine the best example
The best example of an inductive argument is statement A, as it makes a general claim based on specific observations and is the most general statement among the options.

The correct answer is: A.",(A) You probably will not be able to afford any of the paintings,"Let's think step-by-step.

1. Inductive arguments are based on general principles or observations that can be applied to specific cases.
2. The statement ""You probably will not be able to afford any of the paintings"" is an example of an inductive argument because it is making a general claim about the likelihood of finding a painting to take home.
3. The statement ""The art is overpriced"" is not an example of an inductive argument because it is making a specific claim about the price of the paintings.
4. The statement ""You won’t find a painting to take home with you"" is not an example of an inductive argument because it is making a specific claim about the availability of paintings.
5. The statement ""You Will find a painting you can afford if you keep looking"" is an example of an inductive argument because it is making a general claim about the likelihood of finding a painting to take home.

First, we need to identify the flights cancelled in February. We can do this by looking at the bar chart.

The bar chart shows the number of flights cancelled in each airport in February. We can see that Gatwick Airport had 19 flights cancelled.

Now, we need to find out what proportion of flights cancelled in February were Gatwick Airport flights. We can do this by dividing the number of Gatwick Airport flights cancelled by the total number of flights cancelled.

The total number of flights cancelled in February is 40.

So, the proportion of Gatwick Airport flights cancelled is 19/40.

The correct answer is: B,19.","To determine the proportion of flights cancelled in February that were Gatwick Airport flights, we need to look at the bar representing Gatwick in the February category. The height of the bar indicates the number of flights cancelled. 

- Gatwick flights cancelled in February: approximately 19 flights.

Now, we can calculate the proportion:

Proportion = (Number of Gatwick flights cancelled / Total number of flights cancelled in February) * 100

Proportion = (19 / (31 + 19 + 25 + 19)) * 100

Proportion = (19 / 94) * 100

- Gatwick: 15 flights cancelled
- Stansted: 20 flights cancelled

Total flights cancelled = 25 + 15 + 20 = 60 flights cancelled

2. **Identify the total number of cancelled flights for all three airports in November:**
   - The total number of cancelled flights for all three airports in November is the sum of the cancelled flights for Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted.
   - Heathrow: 30
   - Gatwick: 20
   - Stansted: 10

""""""","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to find the average speed of the 07:50 train departure. The distance travelled is 164 miles, so the average speed is:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Distance travelled}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{164 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 2.73 \text{ mph}
\]

Next, we need to find the average speed of the 10:30 train departure. The distance travelled is also 164 miles, so the average speed is:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Distance travelled}}{\text{Time taken}} = \frac{164 \text{ miles}}{105 \text{ minutes}} = 1.53 \text{ mph}
\]

The difference in the average speeds is:
\[
\text{Difference} = 2.73 \text{ mph} - 1.53 \text{ mph} = 1.2 \text{ mph}

The correct answer is: 1.2.","To find the difference in the average speeds of the 07:50 and 10:30 train departures, we first need to calculate the speed of each train.

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 164 miles / 7 hours = 23.43 mph

For the 10:30 train:
Speed = 164 miles / 9 hours = 18.22 mph

Now, we find the difference in speeds:
Difference = Speed of 10:30 train - Speed of 07:50 train
Difference = 18.22 mph - 23.43 mph = -5.21 mph

Since the difference is negative, it means the 10:30 train is slower than the 07:50 train.

To convert this difference to miles per hour, we take the absolute value:
Difference = 5.21 mph

The closest option to 5.21 mph is 5 mph.

Therefore, the answer is B.","Let's think step-by-step.

1. First, we need to find the speed of the 07:50 train. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (164 miles) by the time taken (7 hours).

2. Next, we need to find the speed of the 10:30 train. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (164 miles) by the time taken (9 hours).

3. To find the difference in speeds, we need to subtract the speed of the 10:30 train from the speed of the 07:50 train.

4. Finally, we need to round the difference to the nearest mph.

The correct answer is: B. 5mph.",['numerical'],B," The correct answer is B.

""""""","To answer this question, I will follow these steps:

1. Analyze the image to identify the relevant data.
2. Calculate the average monthly revenue for Moen from January to June.
3. Select the correct answer from the options provided.

Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the relevant data.
The image shows a line graph with four different lines representing the revenue of four companies: Moen, Binder, Graff, and Smiths. The x-axis represents the months from January to June, and the y-axis represents the revenue in thousands.

Step 2: Calculate the average monthly revenue for Moen from January to June.
To calculate the average monthly revenue for Moen, we need to find the total revenue generated by Moen in the given period and divide it by the number of months.

- Total revenue for Moen from January to June: 
  (20,000 + 25,000 + 28,000 + 22,000 + 26,000) = 117,000
- Number of months: 6

Average monthly revenue for Moen: 
117,000 / 6 = 19,500

Step 3: Select the correct answer from the options provided.
The correct answer is: B) 7,500.","To find the average monthly revenue generated by Moen from January to June, we need to add up the revenues for each month and then divide by the number of months.

- February: 25,000
- March: 28,000
- April: 29,000
- May: 26,000
- June: 27,500

Total revenue = 27,500 + 25,000 + 28,000 + 29,000 + 26,000 + 27,500 = 165,000

Number of months = 6

Average monthly revenue = Total revenue / Number of months

1. The customer has 35 minutes of same network calls, 45 minutes of other network calls, and 62 texts.
2. The original cost of these minutes is $3.60 + $4.90 + $6.50 = $15.00.
3. The cost has increased by 20%, so the new cost is $15.00 + 0.20 * $15.00 = $15.00 + $3.00 = $18.00.
4. The correct answer is the total cost after the increase, which is $18.00.

The correct answer is: B.","To find the total cost after a 20% increase, we first need to calculate the total cost before the increase.

For Royal Plan:
- Standard Calls: 35 minutes * $0.24/minute = $8.40
- Other Network Calls: 45 minutes * $0.24/minute = $10.80
- Texts: 62 texts * $0.15/text = $9.30

Total cost before increase = $8.40 + $10.80 + $9.30 = $28.50

For 20% increase:
- Increase = 20% of $28.50 = 0.20 * $28.50 = $5.70
- Total cost after increase = $28.50 + $5.70 = $34.20

Therefore, the total cost after a 20% increase is $34.20.

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of the customer's current usage.
2. Then, we need to calculate the new cost after a 20% increase.

- New cost = 142 minutes * 1.20

Step 3: Select the correct answer from the given options.

- C) 36.58
- D) 36.68

Step 1: Calculate the total minutes of standard calls for the customer.
The customer makes 3,120 minutes of standard calls a month for three months.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of standard calls for the customer.
The cost per minute is 30p.

Step 3: Calculate the refund due.
The refund is the difference between the total cost and the correct amount.

Step 4: Calculate the refund amount.
Refund = Total cost - Correct amount

Let's calculate the refund amount.

Step 1: Total minutes of standard calls for the customer.
3,120 minutes

Step 2: Total cost of standard calls for the customer.
3,120 minutes * 30p/minute = 936

3. Multiply the total minutes by the cost per minute:
   - 3,120 minutes * 0.30 GBP/minute = 936 GBP

4. Subtract the refund amount from the total cost:

1. First, we need to calculate the total cost of standard calls for the customer.
   - The customer makes 3,120 minutes of standard calls a month.
   - The cost per minute is 30p.
   - So, the total cost of standard calls per month is 3,120 * 30p = 936.

2. Next, we need to calculate the total cost of standard calls for three months.
   - The customer makes 3,120 minutes of standard calls a month.
   - The cost per minute is 30p.
   - So, the total cost of standard calls for three months is 3,120 * 30p * 3 = 936 * 3 = 2,808.

3. Now, we need to calculate the refund due to the incorrect charging.
   - The customer is charged incorrectly at 30p per minute.
   - The correct cost per minute should be 25p.
   - So, the refund due is 2,808 * 30p - 936 * 25p = 8424 - 2340 = 6084.

- The second row has boxes in the order: A, B, C, D, E.

Step 3: Apply the rule to determine the next box in the sequence.
- The pattern is that the second row is a mirror image of the first row.
- Therefore, the next box in the sequence should be the same as the first box in the second row, which is A.

""""""","To solve this task, we need to analyze the sequence of shapes and determine which one logically comes next.

Looking at the first row, we see that the sequence of shapes is:
1. A black square
2. A black rectangle
3. A black rectangle
4. A black circle

In the second row, the sequence of shapes is:
1. A black circle
2. A black rectangle
3. A black rectangle
4. A black square

From this pattern, we can see that the sequence alternates between a black square and a black rectangle.

Based on this pattern, the next shape in the sequence should be a black rectangle.

The correct answer is: D.","The sequence of images shows a pattern where each box has a black shape and a white shape. The black shapes are positioned in the left half of the box, and the white shapes are positioned in the right half. The black shapes are consistently the same shape in each row, while the white shapes vary.

In the first row, the black shapes are rectangles, and the white shapes are circles. In the second row, the black shapes are rectangles, and the white shapes are circles.

To determine which box comes next in the sequence, we need to look at the pattern of the shapes. The black shape in the first box of the second row is a rectangle, and the white shape is a circle. The black shape in the second box of the second row is a rectangle, and the white shape is a circle.

The pattern suggests that the next box will have a black rectangle on the left and a white circle on the right.

Therefore, the answer is D.",The correct answer is: D.,['inductive'],A,"The correct answer is A. Square moves around frame in an anti-clockwise direction with each turn. Rectangle is shaded for one frame, and unshaded for two frames with each turn. Oval appears at the top of the rectangle in every third frame with each turn.",./images/v1_280.png

These are called simultaneous equations and are encountered at GCSE Maths.  6F = 2F + 2O - 0.50    Via a simple rearrangement and simplification of the equation we arrive at:  6F - 2F = 2O - 0.50  4F = 2O - 0.50  We know that an Oatbar is 1.75, hence two Oatbars (2O = 2 x 1.75) cost 3.50.

First, we need to determine the cost of a BarBox. According to the information provided, a BarBox costs £0.50 cheaper than buying the individual BarBars separately.

Next, we need to determine the cost of a FruitBar. According to the information provided, a FruitBar costs twice as often as an OatBar.

Now, we can calculate the cost of a BarBox. Since a BarBox costs £0.50 cheaper than buying the individual BarBars separately, and a BarBox costs the same as two OatBars, we can determine the cost of a BarBox.

First, we need to understand the relationship between the different types of health food products.

- FruiBars are sold twice as often as OatBars.
- BarBoxes are sold twice as expensive as 3 FruiBars.
- A BarBox contains two of each of the bar types.
- Half of OatBars' sales are sold through BarBoxes.
- A BarBox is $10.50 cheaper than buying the individual Bars separately.

Based on the information provided, we can infer that BarBoxes contain two of each of the bar types, and half of OatBars' sales are sold through BarBoxes. This means that BarBoxes are a combination of two FruiBars and two OatBars.

Now, let's analyze the pricing information:
- BarBoxes are twice as expensive as 3 FruiBars.
- A BarBox is $10.50 cheaper than buying the individual Bars separately.

Since BarBoxes contain two FruiBars and two OatBars, we can calculate the cost of a BarBox as follows:
- Cost of 2 FruiBars = 2 * $3 = $6
- Cost of 2 OatBars = 2 * $1.50 = $3
- Total cost of a BarBox = $6 + $3 = $9

Therefore, the correct answer is: B. False.",A,"Let's think step-by-step.

Step 1: Analyze the given information about the store selling different types of health food products.

Step 2: Understand the relationship between FruiBars, OatBars, and BarBoxes.

Step 3: Determine the cost of BarBoxes and OatBars.

Step 4: Identify the relationship between the sales of BarBoxes and OatBars.

Step 5: Analyze the statement that half of OatBars' sales are sold through BarBoxes.

Step 6: Determine the relationship between the cost of BarBoxes and the cost of individual BarBars.

Step 7: Analyze the statement that a BarBox is $10.50 cheaper than buying the individual Bars separately.

Step 8: Determine the relationship between the cost of BarBoxes and the cost of individual BarBars.

The correct answer is: B. False",['deductive'],A," We have not been given the sales figures. However, we are given the relationships between the bars sold: Barbox combines two of each (2 x Oatbars + 2 x Fruitbars). Half of Oatbar sales are sold through Barboxes.  If 2 are sold each time as part of the Barbox, and this represents half of the sales of Oatbars, then 4 oatbars are sold each time a Barbox purchase is made.     Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.     Thus, the answer to the question is True, also considering that sold implies that sales have been made, so, the sales figure must be greater than 0 and follow the relationships described above.",./images/v1_289.png

Now, let's analyze each statement:

(A) Britain national debt involved William II. - This statement is true because the debt is related to William II's war.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is asking if spending £450 on Wood might require spending a further £600 on Brick.

Step 2: Analyze the information.
The cost of Wood is £50 per m², and the cost of Brick is £2m².

Step 3: Calculate the cost of Brick.
If £450 is spent on Wood, then £450/£50 = 9m² of Wood is used.

Step 4: Calculate the cost of Brick.
If 9m² of Wood is used, then 9m² x £2/m² = £18m² of Brick is used.

Step 5: Calculate the cost of Brick.
If £18m² of Brick is used, then £18m² x £2/m² = £36m² of Brick is used.

Step 6: Calculate the cost of Brick.
If £450 is spent on Wood, then £450 - £18m² = £27m² of Brick is used.

Step 7: Calculate the cost of Brick.
If £27m² of Brick is used, then £27m² x £2/m² = £54m² of Brick is used.

Step 8: Compare the costs.
If £450 is spent on Wood, then £54m² of Brick is used, which is more than £60m² of Brick.

Step 9: Determine the answer.

- For every 1m³ of wood used, a quarter of the price of metal is used.
- For every 1m³ of wood used, 25% of the size in metal must be used.

Step 2: Determine the relationship between wood and brick/metal.
- For every 1m³ of wood used, 2m³ of brick and wood are used.
- For every 1m³ of wood used, a quarter of the price of metal is used.
- For every 1m³ of wood used, 25% of the size in metal must be used.

Step 3: Calculate the cost of brick and wood in relation to metal.
- If 2m³ of brick and wood are used for every 1m³ of wood, then 2m³ of brick and wood are used for every 1m³ of wood.
- If a quarter of the price of metal is used for every 1m³ of wood, then the cost of brick and wood is 25% of the cost of metal.

Step 4: Determine the relationship between wood and brick/metal.
- If 2m³ of brick and wood are used for every 1m³ of wood, then 2m³ of brick and wood are used for every 1m³ of wood.
- If 25% of the cost of metal is used for every 1m³ of wood, then the cost of brick and wood is 25% of the cost of metal.

Step 5: Compare the costs.
- If 2m³ of brick and wood are used for every 1m³ of wood, then the cost of brick and wood is 2m³ of brick and wood.
- If 25% of the cost of metal is used for every 1m³ of wood, then the cost of brick and wood is 25% of the cost of metal.

Step 6: Determine the correct answer.
- If 2m³ of brick and wood are used for every 1m³ of wood, then the cost of brick and wood is £600.

Step 2:
Lucy's annual salary is twice David's salary, so Lucy's salary is 20,000.

Step 3:
Since Lucy's salary is 20,000, which is more than David's salary of 10,000, Lucy must have a higher-paying contract.

3. We need to find the contract type that corresponds to \( 2x \).

Looking at the image, we can see that:
- Charlie has a salary of 35,000, which is \( 2x \).
- Delta has a salary of 60,000, which is \( 2x \).
- Alpha has a salary of 10,000, which is \( 2x \).
- Echo has a salary of 150,000, which is \( 2x \).

""""""","To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of miles Gloriana traveled per lock and the number of bridges they passed through.

First, let's calculate the number of miles Gloriana traveled per lock:
- Gloriana traveled 137 miles on the Grand Union Canal.
- Gloriana traveled 137 miles on the Grand Union Canal.

Next, let's calculate the number of bridges Gloriana passed through:
- Gloriana passed through 2 bridges on the Grand Union Canal.
- Gloriana passed through 2 bridges on the Grand Union Canal.

Now, let's find the difference between the number of miles per lock and the number of bridges:
- Miles per lock: 137
- Bridges: 2
- Difference: 137 - 2 = 135

The correct answer is: 135.","To determine how many more miles per lock Gloriana passed through than the number of bridges, we need to calculate the difference between the miles per lock and the number of bridges.

1. Calculate the miles per lock for Gloriana:
   - Gloriana's run length is 137 miles.
   - Gloriana's number of bridges is 1.
   - Miles per lock = Total run length / Number of bridges
   - Miles per lock = 137 / 1 = 137 miles per lock.

2. Calculate the miles per lock for the other canals:
   - Kennet & Avon: 82 miles per lock
   - Grand Union: 137 miles per lock

3. Compare the miles per lock for Gloriana with the other canals:
   - Gloriana's miles per lock = 137 miles per lock
   - Kennet & Avon's miles per lock = 82 miles per lock
   - Grand Union's miles per lock = 137 miles per lock

4. Determine the difference:
   - Difference = Miles per lock of Gloriana - Miles per lock of other canals
   - Difference = 137 - 82 = 55 miles per lock

5. Calculate the difference in terms of bridges:
   - Gloriana's number of bridges = 1
   - Other canals' number of bridges:
     - Kennet & Avon = 0
     - Grand Union = 2

6. Calculate the difference in terms of locks:
   - Gloriana's number of locks = 1
   - Other canals' number of locks:
     - Kennet & Avon = 105
     - Grand Union = 166

7. Determine the difference in terms of locks:
   - Difference = Number of locks of other canals - Number of locks of Gloriana
   - Difference = 166 - 105 = 61 locks

8. Compare the difference in terms of locks and miles per lock:
   - Difference in locks = 61 locks
   - Difference in miles per lock = 55 miles per lock

9. Since the question asks for the difference in miles per lock, the answer is:
   - (A) 2",The correct answer is: B,['deductive'],C,">First, we should calculate the number of miles per lock for both Lancaster and Trent combined. Number of locks: 6+6 = 12. Miles travelled is: 42 + 42 = 84.     Therefore, the number of locks per mile: 84 ÷ 12 = 7. And Gloriana thus passed under only 1 bridge for both Lancaster and Trent.  We subtract that for our mile figure, thus we get 6.",./images/v1_313.png

Step 1: The highest paid job Julia could take up is Job IV, which has a salary of $2500.
Step 2: The lowest paid job Julia could take up is Job I, which has a salary of $800.
Step 3: The difference in pay between the highest paid job and the lowest paid job is $2500 - $800 = $1700.

2. **Calculate the lowest paid job salary:**
   - Job I: $10.00 per hour

3. **Calculate the difference in salary:**

4. The salary for Job I is $8500, while the salary for Job IV is $9500.
5. To find the difference in pay between the highest and lowest paid jobs, we subtract the lowest salary from the highest salary.

3. To find the average amount gambled on Slot machines in 2007, we need to calculate the total amount gambled on Slot machines for 2007 and divide it by the number of attendees.

From the chart:
- 2007 revenue for Slot machines: 4.2 (£100,000)
- 2007 attendance: 15.2 (100,000)

The average amount gambled on Slot machines in 2007 is:

3. To find the average annual change in attendance, we need to calculate the difference between the predicted attendance in 2010 and the actual attendance in 2010.
4. The predicted attendance in 2010 is 16.5 thousand, and the actual attendance in 2010 is 16.5 thousand.
5. The difference between the predicted and actual attendance is 0.

2. The Board can deliver 10% added value through cost-cutting.
3. To find the valuation, we need to calculate the total value of the takeover bid and add the 10% added value.

Step 1: Calculate the total value of the takeover bid.
The total value of the takeover bid = 7 * 2010 projected casino revenues.

Step 2: Add the 10% added value.
10% added value = 0.10 * total value of the takeover bid.

Step 3: Calculate the final valuation.
Final valuation = total value of the takeover bid + 10% added value.

The correct answer is: 44.1 million.","The image shows a bar chart and a table related to Calewall Casino Revenue. The chart indicates revenue in £100,000s for the years 2006 to 2010, with different segments representing revenue from other table games, slot machines, and roulette. The table below the chart shows annual attendance in 100,000s for the years 2006 to 2010.

To determine the valuation of Calewall casino, we need to analyze the information provided in the image. The takeover bid is 7 times the 2010 projected casino revenues. The Board's response is to deliver 10% added value through cost-cutting, which they believe will be worth 4.41 million.

Let's calculate the valuation:

1. **Understand the Offer Price:**
   - The takeover bid is 7 times the 2010 projected casino revenues.

2. **Understand the Board's Response:**
   - The Board believes they can deliver 10% added value through cost-cutting.

3. **Calculate the Valuation:**
   - The offer price is 7 times the projected revenue in 2010.
   - The Board's response is to deliver 10% added value, which is worth 4.41 million.

4. **Combine the Values:**
   - The total valuation is the sum of the offer price and the added value:
     \[
     \text{Total Valuation} = \text{Offer Price} + \text{Added Value}
     \]

5. **Substitute the Values:**
   - The offer price is 7 times the projected revenue in 2010:
     \[
     \text{Offer Price} = 7 \times \text{2010 Projected Revenue}
     \]
   - The added value is 10% of the projected revenue:
     \[
     \text{Added Value} = 0.10 \times \text{2010 Projected Revenue}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Valuation:**
   - Substitute the values into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total Valuation} = 7 \times \text{2010 Projected Revenue} + 0.10 \times \text{2010 Projected Revenue}
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total Valuation} = 7.10 \times \text{2010 Projected Revenue}
     \]

7. **Substitute the Projected Revenue:**
   - The projected revenue is 4.41 million (as per the table in the image):
     \[
     \text{Total Valuation} = 7.10 \times 4.41 \text{ million}
     \]

8. **Calculate the Total Valuation:**
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total Valuation} = 31.07 \text{ million}
     \]

Step 2 Allow for the 0.8% decrease in R&D spend for 2009 compared with 2008  2,483,400 / 0.992 = 2,503,427     Step 3 To the nearest 1000   Thus the correct answer is (C) 2,503,000",./images/v1_338.png

1. The R&D spend in 2009 is given as 1.02 million.
2. The overheads are projected to rise by 1.1% between 2009 and 2010.
3. To find the 2010 predicted R&D sum left after overheads are taken into account, we need to calculate the overheads for 2010.

Let's calculate the overheads for 2010:

- 2010 predicted R&D spend = 1.02 million + 1.1% of 1.02 million
- 2010 predicted R&D overheads = 1.02 million * 1.1%

Now, let's calculate the overheads:

- 2010 predicted R&D overheads = 1.02 million * 0.11
- 2010 predicted R&D overheads = 102,000

Finally, let's find the 2010 predicted R&D sum left after overheads are taken into account:

- 2010 predicted R&D sum left = 1.02 million - 102,000
- 2010 predicted R&D sum left = 918,000

The correct answer is: C. 2.11 million","To determine the 2010 predicted R&D sum left after overheads are taken in to account, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the overheads for 2010:**
   - Given that R&D overheads are 12% of R&D spend in 2009, and R&D spend in 2009 is £1,000,000, the overheads for 2010 can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Overheads for 2010} = 0.12 \times 1,000,000 = 120,000
     \]

2. **Calculate the total R&D spend in 2010:**
   - The overheads for 2010 are 120,000. To find the total R&D spend in 2010, we add the overheads to the 2009 R&D spend:
     \[
     \text{Total R&D spend in 2010} = 1,000,000 + 120,000 = 1,120,000
     \]

3. **Calculate the R&D spend left after overheads are taken in to account:**
   - The R&D spend left after overheads are taken in to account is the total R&D spend in 2010 minus the overheads:
     \[
     \text{R&D spend left} = 1,120,000 - 120,000 = 1,000,000
     \]

4. **Convert the R&D spend left to the nearest million:**
   - The R&D spend left is £1,000,000.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A) 1.02 million**.",The correct answer is: B.1.22 million,['numerical'],D,"Step 1- Total R&D spend in 2009 was 2,483.4 (thousands). So 2,483,400. Step 2- R&D overheads we are told are 12% of spend so 12% x 2,483,400 = 298,008. Step 3- The graph tells us that the R&D spend in 2010 is projected to increase by 1.2%. This will be 2,483,400 x 1.012 = 2,513,200.8.  And we are told in the question that the R&D overheads are expected to increase by 1.1%. This will be 298,008 x 1.011 = 301,286.1.   Step 4- So the available R&D money left after overheads is (2,513,200.8 minus 301,286.1) = 2,211,914.7.   Thus the correct answer is (D) 2.21 million",./images/v1_339.png

1. **Identify the cost of the two most expensive projects before the delay:**
   - Let's assume the cost of the first project is \( x \) and the cost of the second project is \( y \).

2. **Calculate the increase in cost due to delays:**
   - The increase in cost for each project is 2.5% of the original cost.
   - Increase in cost for the first project = \( x \times 2.5\% \)
   - Increase in cost for the second project = \( y \times 2.5\% \)

3. **Add the increase in cost to the original cost:**
   - Total cost for the first project = \( x + x \times 2.5\% \)
   - Total cost for the second project = \( y + y \times 2.5\% \)

4. **Calculate the total R&D spend for 2009:**
   - Total R&D spend = Total cost for the first project + Total cost for the second project

First, we need to find the total number of shares held by Directors, Current employees, and Past employees.

From the pie chart, we can see that:
- Directors hold 16% of the shares.
- Current employees hold 21% of the shares.
- Past employees hold 63% of the shares.

Next, we need to find the number of shares held by Directors, Current employees, and Past employees.

From the table, we can see that:
- Directors hold 1,100 shares at 1st April 2009.
- Directors hold 1,050 shares at 30th April 2009.
- Directors hold 910 shares at 31st May 2009.
- Current employees hold 950 shares at 1st April 2009.
- Current employees hold 820 shares at 30th April 2009.
- Current employees hold 250 shares at 31st May 2009.
- Past employees hold 950 shares at 1st April 2009.
- Past employees hold 1,100 shares at 30th April 2009.
- Past employees hold 550 shares at 31st May 2009.

Now, let's calculate the number of shares not held by Directors:
- Total shares held by Directors = 1,100 + 910 + 910 = 2,920
- Total shares held by Current employees = 950 + 820 + 250 = 1,920
- Total shares held by Past employees = 950 + 1,100 + 550 = 2,500

3. To find the number of shares not held by Directors, we can subtract the percentage of shares held by Directors from the total percentage of shares.
4. The total percentage of shares is 100%, so the percentage of shares held by Directors is 16%.
5. Therefore, the number of shares not held by Directors is 100% - 16% = 84%.
6. We can convert this percentage to a numerical value by multiplying by the total number of shares.
7. The total number of shares is 1,000,000.
8. Therefore, the number of shares not held by Directors is 84% of 1,000,000.
9. We can calculate this by multiplying 84% by 1,000,000.

First, we need to analyze the image to understand the context. The image shows a pie chart representing the distribution of shares among different categories of employees at Leutts in April 2009. The chart also includes a table showing the number of shares held by each director at different dates.

The question asks which director has bought or sold the largest number of shares across the 2-month period shown.

From the pie chart, we can see that the largest share category is ""Past employees,"" which accounts for 63% of the shares.

Now, let's look at the table to find the director who has bought or sold the largest number of shares.

- At 1st April 2009, the directors who have bought or sold the most shares are Geoffrey Yates (910 shares) and Susan Preddy (250 shares).
- At 30th April 2009, the directors who have bought or sold the most shares are Tobey Gilham (950 shares) and Samantha Hoxton (1,100 shares).
- At 31st May 2009, the directors who have bought or sold the most shares are Trudy Stupples (2,400 shares) and Samantha Hoxton (1,100 shares).

Based on the information in the table, we can see that Tobey Gilham has bought or sold the largest number of shares at the 30th April 2009.

The correct answer is: Tobey Gilham.",(B) Trudy Stupples,"Let's think step-by-step.

1. First, we need to find the number of shares bought or sold by each director.
2. We can do this by looking at the table below:

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of shares bought or sold by each director:

| Director | Total Shares |

| Geoffrey Yates | 1,100 + 910 = 2,010 |
| Tobey Gilham | 1,050 + 820 = 1,870 |

| Samantha Hoxton | 950 + 1,100 = 2,050 |
| Trudy Stupples | 1,200 + 2,400 = 3,600 |

4. Comparing the totals, we can see that Trudy Stupples has bought or sold the largest number of shares.

1. First, we need to determine the number of shares Tobey Gilham held at 30th April 2009.
2. We can find this by looking at the table in the image.
3. Tobey Gilham held 950 shares at 30th April 2009.
4. Half of his shareholding would be calculated by dividing 950 by 2.
5. Half of his shareholding is 475.
6. Tobey Gilham sells 475 shares at 45 per share.
7. The total value of the trade is 475 multiplied by 45.
8. The total value of the trade is 20,625.

The correct answer is: 20,625.","To find the value of the trade, we need to calculate the total value of Tobey Gilham's shares at 31 May 2009 and then determine what half of that value is.

1. **Calculate the total value of Tobey Gilham's shares at 31 May 2009:**
   - At 30 April 2009, Tobey Gilham had 950 shares.
   - At 31 May 2009, he sold half of his shares, so he sold 950 / 2 = 475 shares.
   - The value of his shares at 30 April 2009 is 950 * 45 = 42,250.
   - The value of his shares at 31 May 2009 is 475 * 45 = 20,625.
   - Total value of shares at 31 May 2009 = 42,250 + 20,625 = 62,875.

2. **Determine what half of the total value is:**
   - Half of the total value = 62,875 / 2 = 31,437.50.

3. **Convert the value to a monetary amount:**
   - The value of the trade is 31,437.50.

1. First, we need to determine the total number of shares Tobey Gilham held at 30th April 2009.
2. We can find this by adding the number of shares held by Directors, Current employees, and Past employees.

Number of shares held at 30th April 2009:
- Directors: 1,100
- Current employees: 950
- Past employees: 950

Total number of shares = 1,100 + 950 + 950 = 2,000

3. Next, we need to determine the number of shares Tobey Gilham sold at 31st May 2009.
4. We can find this by subtracting the number of shares he held at 30th April 2009 from the total number of shares.

Shares sold = Total number of shares - Number of shares held at 30th April 2009
= 2,000 - 2,000

1. The total number of £400,000 Apline houses sold in 2009 is given as 270.
2. This number represents 80% of the annual sales target.
3. To find the annual sales target, we can set up the equation: 80% of the annual sales target = 270.
4. Solving for the annual sales target, we get: Annual sales target = 270 / 0.8 = 337.5.
5. Since the annual sales target is split equally across 5 salerooms, the individual sales target for each salesroom is: 337.5 / 5 = 67.5.

1. **Calculate the total number of £400,000 Apline houses sold in 2009:**
   - From the image, the total number of £400,000 Apline houses sold is 270.

2. **Determine the annual sales target:**
   - The image states that the total number of £400,000 Apline houses sold in 2009 represented 80% of the annual sales target.
   - Therefore, the annual sales target is \( \frac{270}{0.80} = 337.5 \).

3. **Calculate the individual sales target for each salesroom:**
   - Since the target is split equally across 5 salerooms, the individual sales target for each salesroom is \( \frac{337.5}{5} = 67.5 \).

4. **Select the closest option from the given choices:**
   - The closest option to 67.5 is 65, which corresponds to option D.

Therefore, the individual sales target for each salesroom was 65.

The correct answer is: D","Let's think step-by-step.

1. First, we need to find the total number of £400,000 Apline houses sold in 2009.
2. We know that this number represents 80% of the annual sales target.
3. Let's denote the annual sales target as T.
4. Therefore, the number of £400,000 Apline houses sold in 2009 is 0.80 * T.
5. We are given that this number is 80% of the annual sales target.
6. So, 0.80 * T = 400,000.
7. To find the annual sales target T, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.80.
8. T = 400,000 / 0.80.
9. T = 500,000.

Now, we need to find the individual sales target for each salesroom.

1. If the total number of £400,000 Apline houses sold in 2009 is 80% of the annual sales target, then each salesroom's sales target is 50% of the annual sales target.
2. Therefore, the individual sales target for each salesroom is 0.50 * T.
3. So, the individual sales target for each salesroom is 0.50 * 500,000.
4. The individual sales target for each salesroom is 250,000.

2. The price ranges are £200,000, £300,000, £400,000, and £500,000.
3. The chart also shows the number of sales for each month of the year, with January to June and July to December.
4. To find the total value of the sales, we need to calculate the total number of sales and multiply it by the average house price.

Now, let's calculate the total number of sales:
- £200,000: 310 sales
- £300,000: 340 sales
- £400,000: 230 sales
- £500,000: 150 sales

Total number of sales = 310 + 340 + 230 + 150 = 950

Next, we need to find the average house price:
- £200,000: 310 sales / 310 = £66,667
- £300,000: 340 sales / 340 = £10,000
- £400,000: 230 sales / 230 = £10,000
- £500,000: 150 sales / 150 = £10,000

Average house price = £66,667 + £10,000 + £10,000 + £10,000 = £106,667

Finally, we can calculate the total value of the sales:
- Total value = 950 sales * £106,667 average price = £100,000,000

The correct answer is: 100,000,000.","To find the total value of 2009 Alpine house sales, we need to add up the sales figures for each price range shown in the bar chart.

1. For the £200,000 range:
   - January: 310
   - June: 340
   Total for £200,000: 310 + 340 = 650

2. For the £300,000 range:
   - January: 460
   - June: 490
   Total for £300,000: 460 + 490 = 950

3. For the £400,000 range:
   - January: 230
   - July: 270
   Total for £400,000: 230 + 270 = 500

4. For the £500,000 range:
   - January: 150
   - July: 175
   Total for £500,000: 150 + 175 = 325

Now, add up all the totals:
650 (£200,000) + 950 (£300,000) + 500 (£400,000) + 325 (£500,000) = 2625

Therefore, the total value of 2009 Alpine house sales is 2625 million.

For the Southern and Eastern region, the forecast is scaled back by a fifth.
- Previous Year: 170 million
- Current Year: 160 million
- Next Year's Forecast: 160 million / 5 = 32 million

Step 3:
Add the projected sales for all 5 regions.
- Northern: 77.5 million
- Southern: 32 million
- Eastern: 275 million
- Western: 270 million
- Central: 125 million

Total Projected Sales = 77.5 + 32 + 275 + 270 + 125 = 919.50 million

The correct answer is: C. 919.50 million","To find the total projected sales for all 5 regions, we need to calculate the projected sales for each region and then sum them up.

1. Northern Region:
   - Previous Year: 310 million
   - Current Year: 310 million
   - Next Year's Projections: 320 million (scaled back by a quarter)

2. Southern Region:
   - Previous Year: 170 million
   - Current Year: 160 million
   - Next Year's Projections: 165 million (scaled back by a fifth)

3. Eastern Region:
   - Previous Year: 290 million
   - Current Year: 300 million
   - Next Year's Projections: 275 million (scaled back by a fifth)

4. Western Region:
   - Previous Year: 255 million
   - Current Year: 280 million
   - Next Year's Projections: 270 million (scaled back by a fifth)

5. Central Region:
   - Previous Year: 110 million
   - Current Year: 90 million
   - Next Year's Projections: 125 million (scaled back by a quarter)

Now, let's calculate the total projected sales for all 5 regions:

- Northern Region: 320 million
- Southern Region: 165 million
- Eastern Region: 275 million
- Western Region: 270 million
- Central Region: 125 million

Total projected sales = 320 + 165 + 275 + 270 + 125 = 1,155 million

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 1,155 million.","Let's think step-by-step.

1. First, we need to calculate the total projected sales for the Northern and Western regions if they are scaled back by a quarter.
2. Next, we need to calculate the total projected sales for the Southern and Eastern regions if they are scaled back by a fifth.
3. Then, we need to add the scaled-back sales for all regions to find the total projected sales.

Step 1: Calculate the scaled-back sales for Northern and Western regions.
- Northern: 320 million * 0.25 = 75 million
- Western: 270 million * 0.25 = 67.5 million

Step 2: Calculate the scaled-back sales for Southern and Eastern regions.
- Southern: 165 million * 0.25 = 41.25 million
- Eastern: 275 million * 0.25 = 68.75 million

Step 3: Add the scaled-back sales for all regions.
- Total projected sales = 75 million + 67.5 million + 41.25 million + 68.75 million + 110 million = 268.5 million

1. The image shows a line graph comparing the GDP per person for France and the UK from 2005 to 2009.
2. The graph indicates that the GDP per person for both countries fluctuated over the years.
3. To find the average GDP per person for France and the UK, we need to calculate the total GDP per person for both countries and divide by the number of years.

Calculating the total GDP per person:
- France: 23,500 (2005), 23,250 (2006), 23,750 (2007), 24,000 (2008), 24,500 (2009)

1. First, we need to identify the city with the lowest number of people under the age of 15 at the start of the year 2000.
2. We can do this by comparing the population numbers for each city under the age of 15 at the start of the year 2000.

   - London: 16,000
   - Birmingham: 18,000

Step 1 -Work through each city shown calculating the number of under 15 year olds. Donot worry about entering the thousands in your calculator this just wastes time.    London: donot bother calculating as it is not a possible answer.

Now, we need to find the difference between the amount Italy spent in 2007 and the target amount. The target amount is 8% more than the amount spent in 2006.

To find 8% of the amount spent in 2006, we multiply 25 billion euros by 0.08.

1. **Identify the target amount:**
   - The target for Italy in 2007 was to spend 8% more on public transport than in 2006.
   - Let's denote the amount spent in 2006 as \( x \).

2. **Calculate the target amount:**
   - The target amount for 2007 is \( x + 0.08x = 1.08x \).

3. **Calculate the actual amount spent in 2006:**
   - According to the image, Italy spent 25 billion euros in 2006.

4. **Calculate the difference:**
   - The difference between the target amount and the actual amount spent is \( 1.08x - 25 \) billion euros.

5. **Determine the value of \( x \):**
   - The image shows that Italy spent 25 billion euros in 2006.
   - Therefore, \( x = 25 \) billion euros.

6. **Calculate the difference:**
   - The difference is \( 1.08 \times 25 - 25 = 27 - 25 = 2 \) billion euros.

Step 2: Calculate the target amount for 2007.

- 8% of 25 billion euros is \(0.08 \times 25 = 2\) billion euros.
- The target amount for 2007 is \(25 + 2 = 27\) billion euros.

Step 3: Determine the actual amount spent in 2007.
- According to the table, in 2007, Italy spent 26 billion euros on public transport.

   - Total number of visitors from Website X: 26,850
   - Number of visitors who made a purchase: 284
   - Average profit per sale = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors who made a purchase
   - Average profit per sale for Website X = 26,850 / 284 ≈ 93.33

2. Calculate the average profit for Website Y:
   - Total number of visitors from Website Y: 82,520
   - Number of visitors who made a purchase: 183
   - Average profit per sale = Total number of visitors / Number of visitors who made a purchase
   - Average profit per sale for Website Y = 82,520 / 183 ≈ 44.33

3. Find the difference in average profit:
   - Difference in average profit = Average profit for Website X - Average profit for Website Y
   - Difference in average profit = 93.33 - 44.33 ≈ 49

Therefore, the difference in profit made from Website X compared to Website Y is approximately 49. The correct answer is A.","Let's think step-by-step.

First, we need to find the total profit made from Website X and Website Y.

Profit from Website X:
\[ 284 \times 12 = 3408 \]

Profit from Website Y:
\[ 183 \times 12 = 2196 \]

Now, we can calculate the difference in profit between Website X and Website Y:
\[ 3408 - 2196 = 1212 \]

The correct answer is: A,1212.",['numerical'],A,"Step 1- Calculate how many more sales came from Website X than from Website Y.  284 MINUS 183 = 101.  Step 2- Calculate the profit difference. 101 x 12 = 1,212  Thus the correct answer is (A) 1,212",./images/v1_371.png
