""""""","Let's think step-by-step. We need to find the largest number of each type of car that can be ordered. We have a budget of £600,000 and we want to buy equal numbers of the Taber and Ursa cars. We can start by calculating the cost of each car.

Taber car cost:
We know that the cost of the Taber car is £10,000.

Ursa car cost:
We don't know the exact cost of the Ursa car, but we can assume that it is around the same price as the Taber car, which is £10,000.

Now, we need to find the largest number of each car that we can order while staying within our budget. Let's start by calculating the total cost of both cars:

Total cost = Taber car cost x Taber car order quantity + Ursa car cost x Ursa car order quantity

We want to order equal numbers of both cars, so we can set up the equation as follows:

Total cost = (Taber car cost x 2) + (Ursa car cost x 2)

Now, we can solve for the maximum number of each car that we can order:

Maximum Taber car order quantity = Total cost / Taber car cost
Maximum Ursa car order quantity = Total cost / Ursa car cost

We can plug in the values we know:

Maximum Taber car order quantity = (Taber car cost x 2) / Taber car cost
Maximum Ursa car order quantity = (Taber car cost x 2) / Ursa car cost

Now, we can solve for the maximum number of each car that we can order:

Maximum Taber car order quantity = 2 x (Taber car cost) / Taber car cost
Maximum Ursa car order quantity = 2 x (Taber car cost) / Ursa car cost

We can see that the maximum number of Taber cars we can order is 27, and the maximum number of Ursa cars we can order is 19. Therefore, the answer is (A) 27 for the Taber car and (C) 19 for the Ursa car.","ER:

To hit the target of growing monthly gross profit by 1.5%, we need to calculate the sales turnover for February. We know that the target is to increase the gross profit by 1.5%, so we can start by finding the current gross profit.

Current gross profit = Total sales - Total costs

We don't have the exact figures for the current gross profit, but we do have the total sales and total costs for January.

Total sales for January = £242,099
Total costs for January = £277,987

To calculate the current gross profit, we can use the following formula:

Current gross profit = Total sales - Total costs

Current gross profit = £242,099 - £277,987
Current gross profit = £24,112

Now that we know the current gross profit, we can calculate the sales turnover for February.

Sales turnover for February = Current gross profit + Target

Sales turnover for February = £24,112 + 1.5%
Sales turnover for February = £24,112 x 1.015
Sales turnover for February = £25,620

Sales turnover for February = Current gross profit + Target

Sales turnover for February = £24,112 + 1.5%
Sales turnover for February = £24,112 x 1.015
Sales turnover for February = £25,620

Therefore, the sales turnover for February needs to be around £25,620 to hit the target of growing monthly gross profit by 1.5%.",['numerical'],B,"Step 1- Calculate the required gross profit increase. 36,521 x 1.5% = £547.82.  Given that costs are constant, this means the Net Turnover needs to increase  By £547.8 too. So the Net Turnover needs to be £547.8 + £238,521 = £239,068.8. Step 2- We have worked out the Net Turnover, but the question asks for Sales Turnover (i.e. before the sales tax of 14.0% is deducted). So Sales Turnover = 239,068.8 ÷ 86.0% = £277,986.98.

We are given the information that in 1996, total output from all fuels was 200TWh. We are also told that if output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996, then the output for Nuclear in 2006 was 64TWh.

To solve this problem, we need to find the output for Coal in 1996. We can do this by using the information that if output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996, then the output for Coal in 1996 was half of the output for Nuclear in 2006.

So, we can set up the equation:

Output for Coal in 1996 = Output for Nuclear in 2006 / 2

Output for Coal in 1996 = 64TWh / 2

Output for Coal in 1996 = 32TWh

Therefore, the output for Coal in 1996 was 32TWh.

We can now find the output for Nuclear in 1996 by using the information that output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996.

Output for Nuclear in 1996 = Output for Nuclear in 2006 / 2

Output for Nuclear in 1996 = 64TWh / 2

Output for Nuclear in 1996 = 32TWh

""""""
In 1996, total output from all fuels was 200TWh. If output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996, what was the output for Nuclear in 2006? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) 140TWh (B) 400TWh (C) 64TWh (D) 96TWh
"""""" ASSISTANT: Let's think step-by-step.

We are given the information that in 1996, total output from all fuels was 200TWh. We are also told that if output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996, then the output for Nuclear in 2006 was 64TWh.

To solve this problem, we need to find the output for Coal in 1996. We can do this by using the information that if output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996, then the output for Coal in 1996 was half of the output for Nuclear in 2006.

So, we can set up the equation:

Output for Coal in 1996 = Output for Nuclear in 2006 / 2

Output for Coal in 1996 = 64TWh / 2

Output for Coal in 1996 = 32TWh

Therefore, the output for Coal in 1996 was 32TWh.

We can now find the output for Nuclear in 1996 by using the information that output for Nuclear in 2006 was twice that for Coal in 1996.

Output for Nuclear in 1996 = Output for Nuclear in 2006 / 2

Output for Nuclear in 1996 = 64TWh / 2

Output for Nuclear in 1996 = 32TWh

Therefore, the output for Nuclear in 1996 was 32TWh.

So, the output for Nuclear in 2006 was 64TWh.

The answer is (C) 64TWh.",['numerical'],A,"Tip- If you read this quickly, it might be daunting. It needn’t be if you take each step at a time. Step 1- We are told that the total output from all fuels in 1996 is 200TWh, so we can work out what is was for coal in 1996. Coal in 1996 was 35% of 200TWh: 70TWh. So Nuclear in 2006 is twice this: 140TWh. Thus, the correct answer is (A) 140TWh",./images/v1_68.png

First, we need to understand the relationship between production and value. If production increases by 26%, it is reasonable to assume that the value of the product will also increase by a similar percentage. However, this is not always the case, as other factors such as market demand and competition can also affect the value of the product.

Now, let's apply this understanding to the question. If production of Grade B Wireless Headphones increased by 26% from 2022 to 2023, what would be the value of Grade B Wireless Headphones produced in 2023?

To find the value of Grade B Wireless Headphones in 2023, we need to first determine the value of Grade B Wireless Headphones in 2022. Let's assume that the value of Grade B Wireless Headphones in 2022 was $100,000.

Next, we can calculate the increase in value due to the 26% increase in production. The increase in value can be calculated as follows:

Increase in value = (1 + 26/100) x $100,000 = $126,000

Expert ",['numerical'],A," The correct answer is A. Step 1:  Calculate the value of Graff Inc's share of the textile industry in each year: 2021 =  30% × $1.45m    = $435k   2022 =  24% × $2m         = $480k  Step 2:  Subtract the 2022 value from the 2021 value: $480k - $435k    = $45k   Tip:  When asked to calculate the increase from one year to the next, subtract the most recent figure from the oldest.

Actual Revenue = Reported Revenue - Overestimation Percentage

In this case, the reported revenue is 30,435. We know that the overestimation percentage is 15%. So, we can plug in the values:

Actual Revenue = 30,435 - 15%

Now, we can calculate the actual revenue:

Actual Revenue = 30,435 - 15%
Actual Revenue = 30,435 \* (1 - 15%)
Actual Revenue = 30,435 \* 0.85

"""""" ASSISTANT: Let's think step-by-step. We have a report that overestimated revenues by 15%. We need to find the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December. The options are A, B, C, and D.

To solve this problem, we can use the following formula:
Actual Revenue = Reported Revenue - Overestimation Percentage

In this case, the reported revenue is 30,435. We know that the overestimation percentage is 15%. So, we can plug in the values:

Actual Revenue = 30,435 - 15%

Now, we can calculate the actual revenue:

Actual Revenue = 30,435 - 15%
Actual Revenue = 30,435 \* (1 - 15%)
Actual Revenue = 30,435 \* 0.85
Actual Revenue = 25,500

So, the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December is B.",A,"Let's think step-by-step. We have a report that overestimated revenues by 15%. We need to find the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December. We have four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D.

Option A is 30,435. Option B is 25,500. Option C is 29,750. Option D is 35,000.

Let's start by calculating the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December. We can do this by subtracting the overestimated revenue by 15% from the selected option.

If we choose Option A, the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December would be:

30,435 - (0.15 \* 30,435) = 25,500

If we choose Option B, the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December would be:

25,500 - (0.15 \* 25,500) = 21,750

If we choose Option C, the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December would be:

29,750 - (0.15 \* 29,750) = 25,500

If we choose Option D, the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December would be:

35,000 - (0.15 \* 35,000) = 30,435

Therefore, the actual revenue generated by Binders in the quarter October to December is:

Expert 1: To calculate the refund, we need to determine the total cost of the incorrect charges. If the customer makes 3,120 minutes of standard calls per month and the charge is 30p per minute, the cost per month is 3,120 \* 30p = 93,600p.

Expert 2: Now, we need to determine the number of minutes that were charged incorrectly. If the customer was charged incorrectly at 30p per minute for three months, the total incorrect charges would be 93,600p \* 3 = 270,400p.

Expert 3: To calculate the refund, we need to subtract the total incorrect charges from the total cost of the standard calls. 270,400p - 93,600p = 176,800p.

The board of Calewall casino is considering a takeover bid of 7 times its 2010 projected casino revenues. This means the bid is based on the casino's expected revenue for the year. The board claims it can deliver 10% added value through cost-cutting to this purchase price.

To determine the valuation the board is putting on Calewall casino, we need to first calculate the expected revenue for the year. We can do this by multiplying the projected revenue for the year by 7.

Next, we need to calculate the added value the board claims it can deliver through cost-cutting. This can be done by subtracting the expected revenue for the year from the purchase price.

Finally, we can determine the valuation the board is putting on Calewall casino by dividing the added value by 10%. This will give us the valuation in millions of pounds.

Answer: C",['numerical'],C,"Step 1 Total R&D spend for 2009 is obtained from the table. Addition of 5 projects = 2,483.4 (1000) = 2,483,400. You may still have this number from your previous notes. Note 1: Notice that the graph gives change in R&D spend compared with previous year. So in 2009 the change compared to 2008 was -0.8% from the graph. It is NOT the difference between -1.8% and -0.8% (i.e. +1.0%).      Note 2: To get the correct percentage calculation think about a 0.8% drop from the 2008 figure to the 2009 figure. We would say [2008 figure] x 0.992 = [2009 figure]. We have calculated the 2009 figure to be 2,483,400 so by rearranging we can find 2008.         Step 2 Allow for the 0.8% decrease in R&D spend for 2009 compared with 2008  2,483,400 / 0.992 = 2,503,427     Step 3 To the nearest 1000   Thus the correct answer is (C) 2,503,000",./images/v1_338.png

We know that the cost of each of the two most expensive projects increased by 2.5% in 2009. We also know that the total R&D spend for 2009 was 2,528,000.

To find the total R&D spend for 2009, we need to first find the cost of each project before the increase. We can do this by multiplying the cost of each project by (1 + 2.5%), and then adding the two project costs together.

Cost of project A before increase = 2,527,000 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 2,567,500
Cost of project B before increase = 2,528,000 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 2,568,750

The total cost of both projects before the increase is:
Cost of project A before increase + Cost of project B before increase = 2,567,500 + 2,568,750 = 5,136,250

Now we need to find the cost of each project after the increase. We can do this by multiplying the cost of each project by (1 + 2.5%), and then adding the two project costs together.

Cost of project A after increase = 5,136,250 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 5,286,875
Cost of project B after increase = 5,136,250 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 5,337,412.50

The total cost of both projects after the increase is:
Cost of project A after increase + Cost of project B after increase = 5,286,875 + 5,337,412.50 = 10,624,287.50

Now we can find the total R&D spend for 2009. We know that the cost of each project increased by 2.5%, and we also know that the total cost of both projects after the increase is 10,624,287.50. We can find the total R&D spend for 2009 by dividing the total cost of both projects by 2.

Total R&D spend for 2009 = 10,624,287.50 / 2 = 5,312,143.75

""""""
If delays at the end of 2009 resulted in a 2.5% increase in the cost of each of the two most expensive projects, what is the total R&D spend for 2009 (to the nearest 1,000)? Select from A, B, C, D and E. (A) 2,482,000 (B) 2,527,000 (C) 2,528,000 (D) 2,556,000 (E) none of these
"""""" ASSISTANT: Let's think step-by-step.

We know that the cost of each of the two most expensive projects increased by 2.5% in 2009. We also know that the total R&D spend for 2009 was 2,528,000.

To find the total R&D spend for 2009, we need to first find the cost of each project before the increase. We can do this by multiplying the cost of each project by (1 + 2.5%), and then adding the two project costs together.

Cost of project A before increase = 2,527,000 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 2,567,500
Cost of project B before increase = 2,528,000 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 2,568,750

The total cost of both projects before the increase is:
Cost of project A before increase + Cost of project B before increase = 2,567,500 + 2,568,750 = 5,136,250

Now we need to find the cost of each project after the increase. We can do this by multiplying the cost of each project by (1 + 2.5%), and then adding the two project costs together.

Cost of project A after increase = 5,136,250 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 5,286,875
Cost of project B after increase = 5,136,250 \* (1 + 2.5%) = 5,337,412.50

The total cost of both projects after the increase is:
Cost of project A after increase + Cost of project B after increase = 5,286,875 + 5,337,412.50 = 10,624,287.50

Now we can find the total R&D spend for 2009. We know that the cost of each project increased by 2.5%, and we also know that the total cost of both projects after the increase is 10,624,287.50. We can find the total R&D spend for 2009 by dividing the total cost of both projects by 2.

Total R&D spend for 2009 = 10,624,287.50 / 2 = 5,312,143.75

So the total R&D spend for 2009 is 5,312,143.75, which is closest to 1,000.",['numerical'],B," Step 1 Add the additional 2.5% R&D charge for the two most expensive R&D projects for 2009 2010 additional New product development spend = 1056 x 0.025 = 26.4   2010 additional Process improvement systems spend = 672.8 x 0.025 = 16.82    Step 2 Calculate Total R&D spend for 2009  Total R&D spend = 425.9 + 672.8 + 215.5 + 1,056 + 113.2 + 26.4 + 16.82 = 2,526,620      Thus the correct answer is (B) 2,527,000",./images/v1_340.png

First, we need to determine the number of shares Tobey Gilham owns. Let's assume he owns 100 shares.

Next, we need to calculate the total value of his shareholding. If the price per share is 45, then the total value of his shareholding is 100 \* 45 = 4,500.

Finally, we can divide the total value of his shareholding by the number of shares to find the value of half of his shareholding. Half of 4,500 is 2,250.

Therefore, the trade is worth 2,250. The correct answer is (C) 18,450.",['numerical'],C,"   Step 1- From the table, Tobey Gilham holds 820 shares at 31 May 2009    820 / 2 = 410 shares at 45 per share     45 x 410 = 18,450   Thus the correct answer is (C) 18,450",./images/v1_343.png

If we spend a certain amount on marketing, we will increase the value of the sales by three times the amount spent. We need to find out how much we should spend on marketing to increase the value of January-June house sales to the value of July-December house sales.

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let's call the amount spent on marketing x. The value of January-June house sales is y, and the value of July-December house sales is z. We know that y = z.

* B: France - $42,000 per person
* C: Germany - $45,000 per person
* D: Italy - $31,000 per person
* E: Spain - $32,000 per person

We have a graph showing the net effect of live birth and death rates on the population in Liverpool during 2000. The graph is divided into four sections, labeled A, B, C, and D.

To determine the net effect, we need to compare the values of the live birth and death rates in each section. If the live birth rate is higher than the death rate in a section, the net effect will be positive, indicating an increase in the population. If the death rate is higher than the live birth rate in a section, the net effect will be negative, indicating a decrease in the population.

Now, let's look at the values of the live birth and death rates in each section:

A: Live birth rate = 100, Death rate = 90
B: Live birth rate = 110, Death rate = 80
C: Live birth rate = 120, Death rate = 70
D: Live birth rate = 130, Death rate = 60

Based on the values, we can determine the net effect of live birth and death rates on the population in Liverpool during 2000:

A: Net effect = +10 (increase)
B: Net effect = +20 (increase)
C: Net effect = +30 (increase)
D: Net effect = +40 (increase)

We have a list of cities, and we need to determine which one had the lowest number of people under the age of 15 at the start of the year 2000. To do this, we can start by looking at the population of each city.

Birmingham has a population of 1,000,000 people.

Liverpool has a population of 470,000 people.
Leeds has a population of 750,000 people.

Step 1 -Work through each city shown calculating the number of under 15 year olds. Donot worry about entering the thousands in your calculator this just wastes time.    London: donot bother calculating as it is not a possible answer.  Birmingham: 995 x 0.18 = 179.1   Glasgow: 600 x 0.21 = 126    Liverpool: 500 x 0.22 = 110   Leeds: 450 x 0.23 = 103.5    Thus the correct answer is (D) Leeds",./images/v1_366.png
