A,['inductive'],"A, C","It is possible to establish very quickly that the green category diagrams all have an X in their center.

"B, D",['inductive'],"B, D","The small square is replaced by a large square split in half, the bottom half of which is colored black (final figure number 1): Final figure number 2 designates a small square, the bottom half of which is also colored. For both the two basic figures, the lower part of the figure has therefore been colored black whereas the size has only been modified for the basic figure number 1. Since the common function figure is the hourglass, it can be deduced that its function is to color the lower half in black. Therefore, the diamond function must change the shape size. Consequently, the correct answer regarding the basic figure's appearance is answer D: the basic figure is a white circle. The function figure is that of the hourglass, whose function is to color the bottom half of the figure in black. Indeed, the final figure in D is a circle whose bottom half is colored black. Regarding the functional figure, the correct answer is answer B: the basic figure is a small white circle whereas the final figure is a large circle. This is a result of the diamond figure; whose function is to enlarge the shape.",./images/v1_2.png
A,['inductive'],D,"In this example, there are two rules to be applied. The first is that the circle moves counter-clockwise in the hexagon.

These are called simultaneous equations and are encountered at GCSE Maths.  6F = 2F + 2O - 0.50    Via a simple rearrangement and simplification of the equation we arrive at:  6F - 2F = 2O - 0.50  4F = 2O - 0.50  We know that an Oatbar is 1.75, hence two Oatbars (2O = 2 x 1.75) cost 3.50.

Hence, 4 times as many Oatbars are sold as Barboxes themselves (including the ones sold through the Barbox), or twice as many oatbars are sold, excluding the ones sold through Barboxes. In either case more Oatbars are sold than Barboxes. Barboxes have sold less than OatBars.

Brick, as stated in the question is £100/m², whereas wood is £90/m², and metal is 4 times as expensive as wood (£90/m² * 4) = £360/m². Lastly, glass is 6 times more expensive than metal (£360/m² * 6) = £2,160/m².

Note 1: Notice that the graph gives change in R&D spend compared with previous year. So in 2009 the change compared to 2008 was -0.8% from the graph. It is NOT the difference between -1.8% and -0.8% (i.e. +1.0%).      Note 2: To get the correct percentage calculation think about a 0.8% drop from the 2008 figure to the 2009 figure. We would say [2008 figure] x 0.992 = [2009 figure]. We have calculated the 2009 figure to be 2,483,400 so by rearranging we can find 2008.         Step 2 Allow for the 0.8% decrease in R&D spend for 2009 compared with 2008  2,483,400 / 0.992 = 2,503,427     Step 3 To the nearest 1000   Thus the correct answer is (C) 2,503,000",./images/v1_338.png

Step 3- The graph tells us that the R&D spend in 2010 is projected to increase by 1.2%. This will be 2,483,400 x 1.012 = 2,513,200.8.  And we are told in the question that the R&D overheads are expected to increase by 1.1%. This will be 298,008 x 1.011 = 301,286.1.   Step 4- So the available R&D money left after overheads is (2,513,200.8 minus 301,286.1) = 2,211,914.7.   Thus the correct answer is (D) 2.21 million",./images/v1_339.png
